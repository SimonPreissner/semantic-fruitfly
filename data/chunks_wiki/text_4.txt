in the locker room and a 75-lb steel window fell on his head, detaching both of his retinas and causing him an injury that required three hundred stitches. The Florida Legislature awarded him $23,000 for the incident. According to Jim Wilson in his book "Chokehold", Graham's eyesight was poor because of blade jobs, and because he needed surgery to correct the problem and could not afford the money, he had some wrestlers tamper with the window in order to pass it off as though it was the responsibility of the building. This allegation is disputed by eyewitnesses. Also, "blading" does not cause eye damage according to noted optometrist Dr. Robert W. McCullough and other eye doctors. Due to the injury, Graham was unable to wrestle for fifteen months. He remained as the promoter in Florida until January 21, 1985, when he committed suicide by gunshot after a lifelong battle with alcoholism. </doc> <doc id="2340342" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340342" title="Xylanase"> Xylanase Xylanase (, "endo-(1->4)-beta-xylan 4-xylanohydrolase", "endo-1,4-xylanase", "endo-1,4-beta-xylanase", "beta-1,4-xylanase", "endo-1,4-beta-D-xylanase", "1,4-beta-xylan xylanohydrolase", "beta-xylanase", "beta-1,4-xylan xylanohydrolase", "beta-D-xylanase") is the name given to a class of enzymes which degrade the linear polysaccharide beta-1,4-xylan into xylose, thus breaking down hemicellulose, one of the major components of plant cell walls. As such, it plays a major role in micro-organisms thriving on plant sources for the degradation of plant matter into usable nutrients. Xylanases are produced by fungi, bacteria, yeast, marine algae, protozoans, snails, crustaceans, insect, seeds, etc., (mammals do not produce xylanases). However, the principal commercial source of xylanases is filamentous fungi. Commercial applications for xylanase include the chlorine-free bleaching of wood pulp prior to the papermaking process, and the increased digestibility of silage (in this aspect, it is also used for fermentative composting). Apart from its use in the pulp and paper industry, xylanases are also used as food additives to poultry, in wheat flour for improving dough handling and quality of baked products , for the extraction of coffee, plant oils, and starch, in the improvement of nutritional properties of agricultural silage and grain feed, and in combination with pectinase and cellulase for clarification of fruit juices and degumming of plant fiber sources such as flax, hemp, jute, and ramie. Good number of scientific literature is available on key features of xylanase enzymes in biotechnology ranging from their screening in microbial sources to production methods, characterization, purification and applications in commercial sector. Additionally, it is the key ingredient in the dough conditioners s500 and us500 manufactured by Puratos. These enzymes are used to improve the dough's workability and absorption of water. In the future, xylanase may be used for the production of biofuel from unusable plant material. </doc> <doc id="2340343" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340343" title="Makemake"> Makemake Makemake (minor-planet designation 136472 Makemake) is a dwarf planet and perhaps the largest Kuiper belt object in the classical population, with a diameter approximately two-thirds that of Pluto. Makemake has one known satellite, S/2015 (136472) 1. Makemake's extremely low average temperature, about , means its surface is covered with methane, ethane, and possibly nitrogen ices. Makemake was discovered on March 31, 2005, by a team led by Michael E. Brown, and announced on July 29, 2005. Initially, it was known as and later given the minor-planet number 136472. Makemake was recognized as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in July 2008. Its name derives from Makemake in the mythology of the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island. Makemake was discovered on March 31, 2005, by a team at the Palomar Observatory, led by Michael E. Brown, and was announced to the public on July 29, 2005. The team had planned to delay announcing their discoveries of the bright objects Makemake and until further observations and calculations were complete, but announced them both on July 29 when the discovery of another large object they had been tracking, , was controversially announced on July 27 by a different team in Spain. Despite its relative brightness (it is about a fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to its relatively high orbital inclination, and the fact that it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices. Precovery images have been identified back to January 29, 1955. Besides Pluto, Makemake is the only other dwarf planet that was bright enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have detected it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects. The provisional designation was given to Makemake when the discovery was made public. Before that, the discovery team used the codename "Easterbunny" for the object, because of its discovery shortly after Easter. In July 2008, in accordance with IAU rules for classical Kuiper belt objects, was given the name of a creator deity. The name of Makemake, the creator of humanity and god of fertility in the myths of the Rapa Nui, the native people of Easter Island, was chosen in part to preserve the object's connection with Easter. , Makemake is from the Sun, almost as far from the Sun as it ever reaches on its orbit. Makemake follows an orbit very similar to that of : highly inclined at 29° and a moderate eccentricity of about 0.16. Nevertheless, Makemake's orbit is slightly farther from the Sun in terms of both the semi-major axis and perihelion. Its orbital period is nearly 310 years, more than Pluto's 248 years and Haumea's 283 years. Both Makemake and Haumea are currently far from the ecliptic—the angular distance is almost 29°. Makemake is approaching its 2033 aphelion, whereas Haumea passed its aphelion in early 1992. Makemake is a classical Kuiper belt object (KBO), which means its orbit lies far enough from Neptune to remain stable over the age of the Solar System. Unlike plutinos, which can cross Neptune's orbit due to their 2:3 resonance with the planet, the classical objects have perihelia further from the Sun, free from Neptune's perturbation. Such objects have relatively low eccentricities ("e" below 0.2) and orbit the Sun in much the same way the planets do. Makemake, however, is a member of the "dynamically hot" class of classical KBOs, meaning that it has a high inclination compared to others in its population. Makemake is, probably coincidentally, near the 11:6 resonance with Neptune. Makemake is currently visually the second-brightest Kuiper belt object after Pluto, having a March opposition apparent magnitude of 17.0 in the constellation Coma Berenices. This is bright enough to be visible using a high-end amateur telescope. Combining the detection in infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Telescope with the similarities of spectrum with Pluto yielded an estimated diameter from 1,360 to 1,480 km. From the 2011 stellar occultation by Makemake, its dimensions have been initially measured to be . However, this analysis of the occultation data was later reanalyzed, which led to the dimension estimate of without a pole-orientation constraint. This means that Makemake is slightly larger than , making it likely the fourth-largest-known trans-Neptunian object after Pluto, , and , though the error bars with the latter overlap. Makemake was the fourth dwarf planet recognized, because it has a bright V-band absolute magnitude of −0.44. Makemake has a high geometrical albedo of . The rotation period of Makemake is estimated at 7.77 hours. Its lightcurve amplitude is small, only 0.03 "mag". This was thought to be due to Makemake currently being viewed pole on from Earth; however, S/2015 (136472) 1's orbital plane (which is probably orbiting with little inclination relative to Makemake's equator due to tides resulting from its rapid rotation) is edge-on from Earth, implying that Makemake is really being viewed equator-on. Like Pluto, Makemake appears red in the visible spectrum, and significantly redder than the surface of Eris (see colour comparison of TNOs). The near-infrared spectrum is marked by the presence of the broad methane (CH) absorption bands. Methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker. Spectral analysis of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must be present in the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size. In addition to methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes (like propane) may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation. The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of nitrogen ice on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of nitrogen as on Pluto and Triton, where it composes more than 98 percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System. The far-infrared (24–70 μm) and submillimeter (70–500 μm) photometry performed by Spitzer and Herschel telescopes revealed that the surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3 to 7% of the surface. These studies were made before S/2015 (136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake.However, some experiments have refuted these studies. Spectroscopic studies, collected from 2005 to 2008 using the William Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain) were analyzed together with other spectra in the literature, as of 2014. They show some degree of variation in the spectral slope, which would be associated with different abundance of the complex organic materials, byproduct of the irradiation of the ices present on the surface of Makemake. However, the relative ratio of the two dominant icy species, methane and nitrogen, remains quite stable on the surface revealing a low degree of inhomogeneity in the ice component. These results have been recently confirmed when the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake, between 2006 and 2013, that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this study found that the variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous. Makemake was expected to have an atmosphere similar to that of Pluto but with a lower surface pressure. However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake passed in front of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light. The results showed that Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4–12 nanobar on the pressure at its surface. The presence of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake could have a transient atmosphere similar to that of Pluto near its perihelion. Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it. The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via atmospheric escape; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32–36 K), which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane. However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by "New Horizons" suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated. S/2015 (136472) 1, nicknamed MK 2 by the discovery team, is the only known moon of Makemake. It is estimated to be in diameter (for an assumed albedo of 4%) and has a semi-major axis at least from Makemake. Its orbital period is ≥ 12 days (the minimum values are those for a circular orbit; the actual orbital eccentricity is unknown). Observations leading to its discovery occurred in April 2015, using the "Hubble Space Telescope" Wide Field Camera 3, and its discovery was announced on 26 April 2016. Most other large trans-Neptunian objects have at least one known satellite: has one, has two, Pluto has five, and has one satellite. 10% to 20% of all trans-Neptunian objects are expected to have one or more satellites. Because satellites offer a simple method to measure an object's mass, Makemake's satellite should lead to better estimates of its mass. A preliminary examination of the imagery suggests that S/2015 (136472) 1 has a reflectivity similar to charcoal, making it an extremely dark object. This is somewhat surprising because Makemake is the second-brightest-known object in the Kuiper belt. One hypothesis to explain this is that its gravity is not strong enough to prevent bright but volatile ices from being lost to space when it is heated by the distant Sun. Further observations will be needed in order to determine S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit. If it is circular, it would suggest that S/2015 (136472) 1 was formed by an ancient impact event, but if it is elliptical, it suggests that it may have been captured. Alex Parker, the leader of the team that performed the analysis of the images at the Southwest Research Institute, said that S/2015 (136472) 1's orbit appears to be aligned edge-on to Earth-based observatories. This would make it much more difficult to detect because it would be lost in Makemake's glare much of the time, which, along with its dark surface, would contribute to previous surveys failing to observe it. It was calculated that a flyby mission to Makemake could take just over 16 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on a launch date of 21 August 2024 or 24 August 2036. Makemake would be approximately 52 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives. </doc> <doc id="2340344" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340344" title="Sheldon Wolin"> Sheldon Wolin Sheldon Sanford Wolin (; August 4, 1922 – October 21, 2015) was an American political theorist and writer on contemporary politics. A political theorist for fifty years, Wolin became Professor of Politics, Emeritus, at Princeton University, where he taught from 1973 to 1987. During a teaching career which spanned more than forty years, Wolin also taught at the University of California, Berkeley, University of California, Santa Cruz, Oberlin College, Oxford University, Cornell University, and University of California, Los Angeles. He was a notable teacher of undergraduate and particularly graduate students, serving as a mentor to many students who themselves became prominent scholars and teachers of political theory. After graduating from Oberlin College, Wolin received his doctorate from Harvard University in 1950, for a dissertation entitled "Conservatism and Constitutionalism: A Study in English Constitutional Ideas, 1760–1785". After teaching briefly at Oberlin, Wolin taught political theory at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1954 to 1970, and built a political theory program by bringing Norman Jacobson, John H. Schaar, Hanna Fenichel Pitkin, and Michael Rogin into the department. One of Wolin's central concern was how the history of political thought could contribute to understanding contemporary political dilemmas and predicaments. He played a significant role in the Free Speech Movement and with John Schaar interpreted that movement to the rest of the world. During the seventies and eighties he published frequently for "The New York Review of Books". He also wrote opinion pieces and reviews for The New York Times. In 1980, he was the founding editor of the short-lived but intellectually influential journal "democracy" (1980–83). At Princeton, Wolin led a successful faculty effort to pass a resolution urging university trustees to divest from endowment investment in firms that supported South African apartheid. Wolin left Berkeley in the fall of 1971 for the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he taught until 1972. From 1973 through 1987, he was a professor of politics at Princeton University. Wolin served on the editorial boards of many scholarly journals, including "Political Theory", the leading journal of the field in the Anglo-American world. He consulted for various scholarly presses, foundations and public entities, including Peace Corps, American Council of Learned Societies, and the Social Science Research Council. Wolin also served as president of the Society for Legal and Political Philosophy. Wolin was instrumental in founding what came to be known as the Berkeley School of political theory. His approach to the history of political thought offered an original perspective that constituted a formidable challenge to more classical approaches to the study of the history of political thought. It equally challenged behavioralism, the reigning orthodoxy in political science departments. He has been compared to thinkers like Eric Voegelin, Hannah Arendt, and Leo Strauss. In his classic "Politics and Vision", Wolin formulates an interpretative approach to the history of political thought, based on careful study of different theoretical traditions. He pays particular attention to how the latter contribute to the changing meanings of a received political vocabulary, including notions of authority, obligation, power, justice, citizenship, and the state. Wolin's approach also had a bearing on contemporary problems and questions and he notoriously defined the inquiry into the history of political thought, and the study of different traditions and forms of theorizing that have shaped it, “as a form of political education.” Wolin’s approach to the study of political theory consisted of a historical-minded inquiry into the history of political thought to inform the practice of political theory in the present. A consummate reader of texts, he carefully combined attention to both the intellectual and political contexts in which an author intervened and the genres of writing he deployed, with an eye to understanding how a particular body of work shed light on a specific political predicament. But this was no antiquarian exercise. It rather consisted of an attempt to "understand some aspect of the historical past [that] is also conscious of the historical character and locus of [the inquirer's] own understanding. Historicity has to do with the convergence of the two, and the inquirer’s contribution of his present is crucial.” Similarly, his classic essay "Political Theory as a Vocation," written in the context of the Cold War, the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement, mounted a seething critique of Behaviorism and how it impaired the ability to grasp the crises of the time. Thirty years later, he explicitly formulated the importance of political theory and the study of political thought as “primarily a civic and secondarily an academic activity.” Wolin's 2001 study of Alexis de Tocqueville, "Tocqueville Between Two Worlds", constitutes his second summum opus. Cornel West has called it Wolin’s masterpiece, the crowning achievement of “the greatest political theorist of and for democracy of our time.” Wolin’s involvement in the events of the sixties represented a formative experience that set the stage for the transition from an imaginative and erudite scholar of political thought to an original political thinker in his own right. In essays dealing with major thinkers of the recent past, including some of the most formidable bodies of work of the twentieth century, Wolin probed different approaches to both understanding the nature of theory and its bearing on the political from a perspective clearly aligned with the principles of participatory democracy. From this perspective, Wolin engaged with a vast array of thinkers: Theodor W. Adorno & Max Horkheimer, Hannah Arendt, John Dewey, Michel Foucault, Leo Strauss, Harvey C. Mansfield, Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michael Oakeshott, Karl Popper, John Rawls, Richard Rorty, and Max Weber. Politically, Wolin penned essays on a variety of themes and figures, including terrorism, conservatism, Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, and Ronald Reagan. His "The Presence of the Past" offered an original critique of Reaganism, its discourse and practice, and a series of searching reflections on the bicentennial of the American Constitution. His last book, "Democracy Incorporated" (2008) formulates a scathing critique of the administration of George W. Bush and its war on terror and a plea for the recovery of democratic values and practices. In these interventions, Wolin formulated an original non-Marxist critique of capitalism and the fate of democratic political life in the present. In his effort to think about the fate of democracy in the United States, he formulated a novel theorization of modern and postmodern forms of power and how these shaped the limits and horizons of political life in the late twentieth and early twentieth-first centuries. While influenced by Marx's critique of capitalism as a form of power, Wolin's political thought is decidedly non-Marxist in his insistence on participatory democracy, the primacy of the political, and the conviction that a radical theory of democracy requires mapping the forms of power beyond the economy. Wolin's political thought is particularly concerned with the fate of democracy at the hands of bureaucratic imperatives, elitism, and managerial principles and practices. His ideas of “inverted totalitarianism” and “fugitive democracy” constitute well-known signatures of his reflections. Another signature contribution is his account of the liberal-democratic state, which Wendy Brown has characterized as a "neo-Weberian" account of the state, "heavy with rationalities and bureaucratic domination; it is a Marxist-structuralist state, neither identical with nor a simple instrument of capitalism but complexly entwined with it. It is an administrative and penetrative state - those tentacles are everywhere and on everyone, especially the most disempowered; they do not honor public/private distinctions, political/economic distinctions, or even legal/extra-legal distinctions...the contemporary state is a complex amalgam of political, economic, administrative and discursive powers." Out of this diagnosis of the state and its complex relationship to capitalism, Wolin forged the idea of "fugitive democracy." In his view, democracy is not a fixed state form, but a political experience in which ordinary people are active political actors. In this construction "fugitive" stands for the ways in which contemporary forms of power have made this aspiration an evanescent and momentary political experience. Wolin was born in Chicago and raised in Buffalo, New York. At the age of nineteen, Wolin interrupted his studies at Oberlin College to become a US Army Air Forces bombardier/navigator, serving on the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Wolin flew 51 different combat missions serving in the South Pacific, specifically the islands surrounding the Philippines, during World War II. Wolin's team were tasked with Douglas MacArthur's strategy of conducting raids against the Japanese Navy, which required flying low over Japanese destroyers in order to bomb them. This was incredibly risky, as the B-24 was a "big, lumbering aircraft" which was hard to manoeuvre, and this cost the lives of many of Wolin's fellow airmen, "which proved disastrous." Wolin mentioned that his flight mates were all very young at the time, being between nineteen and twenty-four years of age. Wolin mentioned that several of his flight mates, both at the time and years later, suffered psychological problems as a result of their activities in the War. He was married to Emily Purvis Wolin for over sixty years. </doc> <doc id="2340349" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340349" title="James Muspratt"> James Muspratt James Muspratt (12 August 1793 – 4 May 1886) was a British chemical manufacturer who was the first to make alkali by the Leblanc process on a large scale in the United Kingdom. James Muspratt was born in Dublin of English parents, the youngest of three children. At the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a wholesale druggist, but his father died in 1810 and his mother soon afterwards. He left Dublin and in 1812 he went to Spain to take part in the Peninsular War. He followed the British army on foot into the interior, was laid up with fever at Madrid, and, narrowly escaping capture by the French, succeeded in making his way to Lisbon where he joined the navy. After taking part in the blockade of Brest he deserted because of the harshness of the discipline. Returning to Dublin in about 1814, he came into an inheritance and in 1818 established a chemical works in partnership with Thomas Abbott. Here he began to manufacture chemical products such as hydrochloric and acetic acids and turpentine, adding prussiate of potash a few years later. Sodium carbonate, also known as soda ash, is an effective industrial alkali. The manufacture of sodium carbonate from common salt was first developed in France in the 1790s and known as the Leblanc process. Muspratt was attracted towards manufacturing it, but could not raise the capital for the relatively expensive Leblanc plant and also considered that Dublin was not a suitable location for this. He perceived Merseyside as better because of the neighbouring coal fields, the proximity to the salt district of Cheshire, and the proximity to glassmaking industry. The glassmakers were the main prospective customer base for the sodium carbonate alkali. In 1822 he went to Liverpool and took a lease of an abandoned glass-works on the bank of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Though already determined to work the Leblanc process, he did not immediately possess the capital for it, and he therefore continued the production of prussiate of potash, which was profitable, and plough the profits into building the lead chambers and the other necessaries of a complete Leblanc works. Fortuitously in 1823 the duty or tax of £30 per ton was taken off salt. He began to make sodium carbonate alkali by the Leblanc process in 1823. In 1828 he built works at St Helens, (then in Lancashire), in partnership with Josias Gamble, another Irish-born chemist. But after two years the partnership ended and Muspratt moved to Newton-le-Willows, (then in Lancashire). This factory closed in 1851. He was repeatedly involved in litigation because of the pollution caused. In 1828 he was cited as causing a public nuisance and fined one shilling. In 1831 he was indicted but was acquitted on this occasion. In 1838 after a trial lasting three days, with 40 witnesses for the prosecution and 46 for the defence, a jury found Muspratt guilty of "creating and maintaining a nuisance". At this time he was employing 120 on the Vauxhall Road site which had two chimneys, one of which was 50 yards high. In 1851 Muspratt largely withdrew from the business although he supported his sons, Richard and Frederic in starting new alkali works at Wood End, Widnes and Flint. After his retirement in 1857 his business was continued by his four sons. However, in 1867 he took over the management of Frederic's factory at Wood End before passing it on to another son, Edmund. In the 1830s he had experimented in producing sodium carbonate alkali by the ammonia-soda process but was unsuccessful. In 1834–1835, in conjunction with Charles Tennant, he purchased sulphur mines in Sicily, to provide the raw material for the sulphuric acid needed for the Leblanc process. However, when the Neapolitan government imposed a prohibitive duty on sulphur, Muspratt found a substitute in iron pyrites which was introduced as the raw material for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. Muspratt had been one of the original subscribers to the St Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway in 1833 when he purchased 15 shares at £100 each. In 1819 he married Julia Josephine Connor with whom he had 10 children, three of whom died in infancy. He built a house, Seaforth Hall on dunes at Seaforth. In 1825 he helped to found the Liverpool Institute for Boys and in 1848 he assisted his son James Sheridan to establish the Liverpool College of Practical Chemistry. He died at Seaforth Hall in 1886 and was buried in Walton, Merseyside, parish churchyard. </doc> <doc id="2340357" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340357" title="Emperor Houshao of Han"> Emperor Houshao of Han Emperor Houshao of Han (190 BC – 14 November 180BC), personal name Liu Hong, was the fourth emperor of the Han Dynasty in China. He was a son of Emperor Hui, likely by a concubine—although there is some controversy on the subject—and adopted by Emperor Hui's wife, Empress Zhang Yan. At the instigation of his grandmother, Empress Dowager Lü, Empress Zhang had Emperor Houshao's mother put to death. Very little about Emperor Houshao's life and personality is known. There are only a few major important events in his life that are documented (which does not even include the year of his birth). In 188 BC, his father Emperor Hui died, and his brother Liu Gong succeeded to the throne as Emperor Qianshao. In 187 BC, he was made the Marquess of Xiangcheng. In 186 BC, after his brother Liu Buyi (劉不疑), the Prince of Hengshan, died, he was made the Prince of Hengshan, and his name was changed to Liu Yi, likely because it was considered inappropriate to have one's name (or one's male ancestors' names) share characters with one's titles. Some time during or before 184 BC, Emperor Qianshao discovered that he was not in fact now-Empress Dowager Zhang's son and that his mother, like Prince Hong's mother, had been put to death. Emperor Qianshao made the mistake of publicly making the remark that when he grew up, Empress Dowager Zhang would pay for this. Grand Empress Dowager Lü, once she heard of this, had Emperor Qianshao secretly imprisoned within the palace and publicly announced that he was severely ill and unable to receive anyone. After some time, Grand Empress Dowager Lü told the officials that he continued to be ill and incapable of governing, and that he had also suffered a psychosis. She proposed that he be deposed and replaced. The officials complied with her wishes, and he was deposed and put to death. Prince Hong then succeeded his brother to the throne as Emperor Houshao and in effect as Grand Empress Dowager Lü's puppet. Because Grand Empress Dowager Lü was actually the ruling figure, one thing that is normally done when a new emperor succeeds to the throne—the resetting of the calendar year to one—was not done; rather, the calendar continued from the start of Emperor Qianshao's reign. In the autumn of 180 BC, Grand Empress Dowager Lü died of an illness. Emperor Houshao, however, still had few actual powers, because power was still largely controlled by the Lü clan. Indeed, the grand empress dowager's will required him to marry the daughter of her nephew Lü Lu (呂禄) and make her empress. The officials of the imperial government, led by Chen Ping and Zhou Bo, however, formed a conspiracy against the Lü clan, and they were successful in surprising the Lü clan and slaughtering them. Afterwards, the conspirators met and made the assertion that none of the sons of Emperor Hui was actually his. Admitting that they were concerned that these imperial children, when they grew up, would take vengeance on the officials, the conspirators resolved to find a replacement emperor. After a period of disagreement, they settled on Emperor Houshao's uncle, Prince Liu Heng of Dai. Prince Heng soon arrived in the capital Xi'an and was declared emperor, and Emperor Houshao was deposed. Initially, one of the officials involved in the conspiracy, Emperor Houshao's cousin, Liu Xingju, the Marquess of Dongmou, merely expelled Emperor Houshao from the palace and had him stay at the Ministry of Palace Supplies. Some of the imperial guard still wished to resist the coup d'etat, but were eventually persuaded by the officials to desist. Some time later that year, Emperor Houshao was executed. Historians are of the view that his wife, Empress Lü, was also executed, but there is no explicit evidence to support this view. Emperor Houshao, considered to be a mere puppet of Grand Empress Dowager Lü, is often omitted from the official list of emperors of the Han Dynasty. </doc> <doc id="2340359" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340359" title="OpenGALEN"> OpenGALEN OpenGALEN is a not-for-profit organisation that provides an open source medical terminology.

Early phases of the GALEN Programme developed the GRAIL concept modelling language, experimented with different structures for the GALEN Common Reference Model, and, in parallel, tested the usefulness of the approach with a series of clinical demonstrator projects. Later phases of the GALEN Programme, during the late 1990s, have concentrated on robust implementations of GRAIL and the Terminology Server, development of the GALEN Common Reference Model in both scope and detail, and development of tools and techniques to enable the further development, scaling-up and maintenance of the model. An important additional focus has been in developing tools and techniques with which we can map the information found in existing coding and Medical classification schemes to the GALEN Common Reference Model. OpenGALEN has been set up as a not-for-profit Dutch Foundation by the universities of Manchester and Nijmegen to make the results of the GALEN projects available to the world. The GALEN Common Reference Model is the model of medical concepts (or clinical terminology) being built in GRAIL. This model forms the underlying structural foundation for the services provided by a GALEN Terminology Server. The GALEN Common Reference Model is written in the formal language GRAIL (see below). The GRAIL statements in the model are equivalent with sentences like these: The GALEN Common Reference Model is available from the OpenGALEN Foundation as open source. The GALEN tools and technologies were used in France for the development of the French classification of procedures Classification Commune des Actes Médicaux (CCAM). </doc> <doc id="2340361" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340361" title="Fiona Allen"> Fiona Allen Fiona Allen (born 13 March 1965) is an English comedian and actress.

The village is located behind the sand dunes that occupy the estuary of the River Rother, where the seaside settlement of Camber Sands is situated. The village of Camber takes its name from the Camber (la Chambre) the huge embayment of the English Channel located between Rye, old Winchelsea and Old Romney that was gradually lost to "innings" and silting-up following changes to the coastline and the changed course of the Eastern Rother since the Middle Ages. Camber came into its own with the game of golf: it was originally a collection of fishermen's dwellings. By the early 1890s, the number of visitors to Rye increased as tourism became more prevalent. One result of this was the building, in 1894, of "Rye Golf Links" in the area of sand dunes which occupy the shores of Rye Bay. The "Royal William Hotel" opened that year, and gradually the new village expanded. The Rye and Camber Tramway, a tourist railway originally opened for the members of the golf links to carry their gear, was opened in 1895; it closed to the public at the outbreak of World War II and never reopened. Camber Castle, otherwise known as Winchelsea Castle, was built by Henry VIII to guard the western entrance to "the Camber" in the 16th Century and is located halfway between Rye and Winchelsea on the other side of the river. Camber parish was formed in 1956 from the merger of the parishes of Broomhill and St Thomas the Apostle, Winchelsea. The area has two holiday parks and several caravan sites adjacent to the beach. There are also seasonal shops and entertainments. Part of the Site of Special Scientific Interest known as Dungeness, Romney Marsh and Rye Bay is within the parish. This is a site of national biological and geological importance with various habitats such as shingle, saltmarsh, sand dunes and saline lagoons. Each year in November, the Rhythm Riot Festival is held at Pontin's in Camber. </doc> <doc id="2340366" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340366" title="Regal (instrument)"> Regal (instrument) The regal is a small portable organ, furnished with beating reeds and having two bellows. The instrument enjoyed its greatest popularity during the Renaissance. The name was also sometimes given to the reed stops of a pipe organ, and more especially the vox humana stop. The sound of the regal is produced by brass reeds held in resonators. The length of the vibrating portion of the reed determines its pitch and is regulated by means of a wire passing through the socket, the other end pressing on the reed at the proper distance. The resonators in the regal are not intended to reinforce the vibrations of the beating reed or of its overtones (as in the reed pipes of the organ), but merely to form an attachment to keep the reed in place without interfering with its function. A common compass was C/E--c′′′ (four octaves, with a short octave in the bass), though this was by no means standardized. Most regals were placed on a table to be played, and required two people—one to play the instrument, and another to pump the bellows. Michael Praetorius (1618) mentions a larger regal used in the court orchestras of some of the German princes, more like a positive organ, containing reeds at 4′, 8′, and even sometimes 16′ pitch, and having two bellows behind the case. These regals were used not only at banquets but often in place of positive organs in churches. A very small regal, sometimes called a Bible regal because it could be separated into sections and folded up like a book, was also mentioned by the same writer, who stated that these little instruments had an unpleasantly harsh tone due to their tiny resonators, which were not quite an inch long. He states that they were first made in Nuremberg and Augsburg. In England and France, the word "regal" was sometimes applied to reed stops on the organ; Mersenne (1636) states that the word was applied at that time to the vox humana stop. According to Praetorius, the reed stops of pipe organs required constant tuning; he emphasized the fact that the pitch of the stop fell in summer and rose in winter. The pitch of the other stops rose in summer and fell in winter. Because of civil wars and the ravages of time, very few antique regals survive. They were often mentioned in wills and inventories, such as the list of Henry VIII's musical instruments made after his death by Sir Philip Wilder (British Museum Harleian MS. 1415, fol. 200 seq.), in which no fewer than thirteen pairs of single and five pairs of double regals are mentioned (although at that period, "pair" referred to a single instrument). Claudio Monteverdi scored for the regals in his operas, and the instrument was described and illustrated by Sebastian Virdung in 1511, Martin Agricola in 1528, and Othmar Luscinius in 1536. In England, as late as the reign of George III, there was the appointment of tuner of the regals to the Chapel Royal. Drawings of the reeds of regals and other reed pipes, as well as of the instrument itself, are given by Praetorius (pl. iv., xxxviii.). The regal may be seen as the ancestor of the harmonium, the reed organ, and the various varieties of "squeezebox" such as the accordion, the concertina, and the Bandoneón. </doc> <doc id="2340367" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340367" title="Australian Drug Evaluation Committee"> Australian Drug Evaluation Committee The Australian Drug Evaluation Committee or ADEC, was a committee that provided independent scientific advice to the Australian Government regarding therapeutic drugs.

Colegio Nueva Granada was founded in 1938 by Frederic Dever, Doris de Samper and Irwin C. Byington . Its original name was "The Anglo-American School" and Mr. Gabriel Calderon was its first director. Colegio Nueva Granada teaches a U.S. college-preparatory curriculum. Students study for both the U.S. High School Diploma and the Colombian Bachillerato Diploma. The majority of the classes are taught in English with a varied curriculum including Foreign Languages (Chinese and French), Sports, and Technology. The school's staff includes foreign as well as Colombian teachers. The AP system is offered to students, allowing them to gain college credits. Students from this school have been accepted at some of the world's most prestigious universities. Yearly over 50 top universities are invited to visit the campus to recruit interested students in their fields. The CNG student body in 2018 was made up 1,815 students of 33 nationalities (57% Colombian, 10% U.S. citizens, 22% dual citizenship (U.S-Colombian) and 11% from other countries). Moreover, the total number of employees was 388 (Faculty: 287, Administrative support: 56 and General Services: 45). All CNG teachers are certified professionals (additionally, 93 hold master's degrees and 3 have doctorate degrees). Among the social projects in which students participate, Hogar Nueva Granada, Alianza Educativa and personal student Social Service Hours are the most important (as they are mandatory). Hogar Nueva Granada and Alianza Educativa are projects formed to help children and families in need with health and education programs to ensure their futures as Colombian citizens. Yearly, students teach English to approximately 40 children, ages 7 to 14, from the surrounding neighborhoods of Juan XXIII and Bosque Calderón in Bogotá. Others participate in the continuing education program for adults, 18 to 40 years old. This is a joint program, with CAFAM with the help of teacher and student volunteers, to prepare adults to validate elementary school and also to get ready for ICFES exams in the higher levels of education. Colegio Nueva Granada follows the House system tradition. Throughout elementary and middle school, students and teachers form part of one of the four houses (Falcons, Eagles, Hawks and Osprey). Houses compete in both academic and athletic tasks, crowning a winner at the end of the school year, depending on the overall points the house received. The winning team is awarded a trophy that is put in their corresponding school's hallway. In elementary school, students elect their House representatives. In third for House Representative. In fourth for Vice-President, and in fifth for Captain. Anyone can participate. They have to make posters and hang them in the hallway. At the final day of campaign they have to give a 1-minute speech in front of their grade telling why they should get elected. They should have a girl and a boy for each place. However, this tradition lasts only up to Middle School. The school was the host of the Association of American Schools of Central America, Colombia, Caribbean and Mexico meeting in the week of October 13 of 2006. Around 1000 people from all over America came to the school. The school is accredited by the Colombian Ministry of National Education and the US-based Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2017 the school's girls' soccer (football) team and girls' basketball team won the XXII Juegos Binacionales. </doc> <doc id="2340383" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340383" title="Hotta Masayoshi"> Hotta Masayoshi Hotta Masayoshi was the younger son of the 3rd "daimyō" of Sakura, Hotta Masatoki, and was born at the domain's Edo residence. On the death of his father in 1811, he was adopted by his elder brother, the 4th daimyo of Sakura, Hotta Masachika, to secure the family succession. Masachika was of sickly physique and by 1824 there was a movement by the senior line of the Hotta clan to have him removed from office, and replaced by the son of Hotta Masatsu, the daimyo of Katada Domain and a "wakadoshiyori" in the government. This was strongly opposed by most of the leadership of the Sakura domain, and Hotta Masayoshi was appointed daimyo. Almost immediately, the domain was saddled with the fiscally taxing burden of improving coastal defenses in Edo Bay against incursions of the Black Ships. However, Masayoshi proved an able administrator, reforming the domain’s finances, sponsoring studies of "rangaku," especially western military science, and establishing the predecessor of Juntendo University. In April 1829, he was appointed a "Sōshaban" and in August 1834 became "Jisha-bugyō". In May 1837 he was appointed Osaka jōdai, however only two months later he was recalled to Edo to join the ranks of the "rōjū". From 1841, he was regarded as the right arm of Mizuno Tadakuni, the architect of the Tenpō Reforms. However, after Mizuno fell out of favor in 1843 due to failure of the Tenpō Reforms, Hotta also lost his position as rōjū. Returning to Sakura, Hotta remained one of the leaders of the party supporting ending the "sakoku" isolation policy and opening the country to foreign trade. In August 1855, the Ansei great earthquakes struck Japan, and the Hotta clan residence in Edo was destroyed. A week later, senior rōjū Abe Masahiro requested that Hotta return to the ranks of the "rōjū". Abe came under criticism from the "tozama daimyōs", the Imperial Court and various factions within the government for perceived appeasement to the foreign powers in authorizing the signing treaties with the various western powers, starting with the Convention of Kanagawa which effectively ended the 220-year policy of national isolation, and in September 1855 was forced to resign his post, and was replaced by Hotta the following month, although Abe remained one of the "rōjū" and a powerful influence until his death in 1857. On October 17, 1856 Hotta formed and headed an "ad hoc" committee of officials with special knowledge of foreign affairs. In November 1856, he charged the members to come up with recommendations about the terms for opening Japanese ports. The results of their deliberations would become the basis for negotiations which ultimately resulted in the Treaty of Amity and Commerce of 1858 (also known as the Harris Treaty), which open up six ports to American trade, and established extraterritoriality. Based on his knowledge of the events of the Arrow War, Hotta believed that a violent response the United States would arise if the demands of American consul Townsend Harris were refused. However, it was necessary to convince the Emperor Kōmei to accept the treaty. Traveling to Kyoto, Hotta found the Emperor securely in the midst of the "jōi" faction within the Imperial Court, who favored expelling the foreigners from Japan, by force if necessary, and was forced to return to Edo empty-handed. On top of this, "shōgun" Tokugawa Iesada was very ill and factional strife erupted within the Shogunal court over who would be his successor. With these issues still largely unresolved, Hotta was replaced by Ii Naosuke on June 21, 1858, who was given the title of "tairō". On September 6, 1859, Hotta resigned his posts in favor of his son, and went into official retirement. He continued to lend his political support to the Hitotsubashi faction which was opposed to Ii Naosuke, and during Ansei purge of Hitotsubashi partisans, he was placed under house arrest within Sakura Castle, where he died on March 31, 1864 at the age of 55. </doc> <doc id="2340391" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340391" title="Masayuki Suzuki (disambiguation)"> Masayuki Suzuki (disambiguation) Masayuki Suzuki may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2340400" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340400" title="Zak Tales"> Zak Tales Zak Tales is a children's television program created in 1990 by DIC Entertainment and Children's Television Workshop.

It is best known for being the home of the Utah State Aggies men's basketball team and the women's basketball team. It also hosts gymnastics, volleyball, and other sporting events. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level. In addition to sporting events, the Smith Spectrum is utilized for concerts, commencement ceremonies, and other special events central to the Cache Valley community. Originally known as the Assembly Center, the arena's first basketball game was on December 1, 1970, a 95–89 victory over Ohio State. It became known as the Spectrum within the next year, and was named for Dee Glen Smith, founder of Smith's Food and Drug, whose contribution funded a 1988 renovation that added new offices for the athletics department and ticket office. In December 2005, the Utah State Aggies played their 500th game in the Spectrum. In those games, USU amassed a dominating record of 398 wins and 102 losses versus its competition. Over the last 17 seasons since Stew Morrill has been head coach, Utah State has amassed a home record of . In that same time period, the Aggies are against league opponents and in non-conference games at home. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Utah State held the second-longest home winning streak in the NCAA, having won 34 straight home games. The Aggies finished the 2007–08 season as well as the 2008–09 season with undefeated marks at home. Large crowds are another characteristic of the arena, as the Aggies have averaged better than 7,000 fans per game in 38 of their 42 seasons in the Smith Spectrum, and have averaged better than 8,500 fans per game every year since the 2007–08 season. On March 1, 1990, two former Utah State students set off a water bomb that soaked UNLV coach Jerry Tarkanian and other UNLV coaches and players with a blue-green dye. UNLV was awarded two technical free throws and made both of them. UNLV won the game by two points, 84–82. </doc> <doc id="2340403" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340403" title="Liverpool St Helens F.C."> Liverpool St Helens F.C.

The club's first match took place in 1857 when old boys from Rugby school challenged local boys to a game under their school rules. Liverpool Football Club were then formed, the oldest open rugby club in the world. In 1871, the club provided four of the England team that played Scotland in the first rugby international. On 5 February 1877 another Liverpool player, Edward Kewley, was captain of England when they played Ireland in what was the first 15-a-side international. In 1914 the club had three international captains in the first XV, Ronnie Poulton-Palmer (England), F.H. Turner (Scotland) and R.A. Lloyd (Ireland). Other internationals to play for Liverpool include Fran Cotton, Maurice Colclough, Mike Slemen and Kevin Simms. St Helens RUFC was founded in 1919 as St Helens Old Boys, the original membership being predominantly made up of former pupils of Cowley School. Internationals who played for the club include Alan 'Ned' Ashcroft, John Horton, Nigel Heslop and the current club President Ray French. Liverpool and St Helens merged in 1986 and played at Moss Lane which had been the St Helens club’s ground. In the early years of the merger the club had two seasons in National Division One split by one season in Division Two. During this time internationals Dewi Morris and Simon Mason played for Liverpool St Helens. But afterwards it sank to Division Four and spent virtually the whole of the 1990s coming to terms with the professional era.

Their Lomavren language is a mixed language, combining Indo-Aryan and Armenian. The Lom, like the Dom people, are sometimes considered a separate branch of the proto-Romani people who remained in historic Armenia in the 11th century, while the ancestors of the contemporary Romani migrated further west in the 13th and 14th centuries. The names "Dom", "Lom" and "Rom" are likely to have the same origin "(see Names of the Romani people for details)". The Lom are also said to be related to the Lambani people or the Indian Romani; the Lomavren language is also very similar to the Lambani language. The exact number of existing Bosha is difficult to determine, due to the dispersed and often mostly-assimilated nature of the group. Estimates suggest only a few thousand of the people can be found across Armenia and Georgia, while Government census reports only 50 living in the former. Concentrations of Bosha can be found in Yerevan and Gyumri in Armenia. Some of the Bosha in Armenia have adopted the Armenian language and assimilated with the larger Armenian population. In Georgia they live in such cities as Tbilisi, Kutaisi, Akhalkalaki and Akhaltsikhe. They are noted for such occupations as basket weaving and metalsmithing, which are common among settled Roma. In Turkey they live in Artvin, adopted the Turkish language and assimilated. </doc> <doc id="2340410" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340410" title="Dee Events Center"> Dee Events Center Dee Events Center is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the western United States, located in Ogden, Utah.

Maurel was born in Marseille. Educated in music and stagecraft at the Paris Conservatory, he made his debut in opera in 1867, in the city of his birth. The following year, he performed on stage in Paris for the first time. New York first heard him in 1873, when he performed at the Academy of Music. Later, he would sing at New York's Metropolitan Opera (in 1894-96 and 1898–99). Other famous venues at which he appeared included London's Royal Opera House, Covent Garden — in 1873-79, 1891–95 and 1904 — and the Paris Opera, where he was on the roster of singers from 1879 to 1894. Maurel was renowned in Europe and the United States for his vivid stage presence and exceptional acting and make-up skills; but his voice, while well trained and of good quality, was not considered to be as impressive as that of his chief French baritone rivals, Jean Lassalle (1847–1909) and Maurice Renaud (1861–1933). In 1887, Maurel created the role of Iago in "Otello" at La Scala, Milan, and then, in 1893, he created the title role in "Falstaff", again at La Scala. These were the final two, and arguably the greatest, operatic masterpieces composed by Giuseppe Verdi, and it was Verdi who selected Maurel to perform in the premieres. Maurel made operatic history for a third time in 1892 when he was chosen to be the first Tonio in Ruggero Leoncavallo's enduringly popular verismo opera, "Pagliacci". Like many Paris-trained singers of his day, Maurel was equally adept at performing roles in Italian and French. He appeared, too, in several German operas by Richard Wagner (on 30 March 1873 he sang in the first production in Milan of "Lohengrin", to Gabrielle Krauss's Elsa), and was a famous Don Giovanni in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera of the same name. George Bernard Shaw, however, though an admirer of Maurel, claimed that his genius was not Mozartian, and commented that "the problem of how to receive a call from a public statue does not seem to have struck him as worth solving". After retiring from opera, Maurel taught singing in Paris and New York City, where he died at the age of 75. His pupils included the contralto Frances Ingram and the baritones Herbert Heyner and Thomas Quinlan (impresario). Some impressive examples of his vocalism are preserved on gramophone records he made in the early 20th century. These recordings, which include a few French songs and arias from "Otello", "Falstaff" and "Don Giovanni", have been reissued on CD by various companies. Maurel also wrote a number of books on opera and the art of singing, and dabbled in theatrical set design. Volume One of Michael Scott's "The Record of Singing" (London: Duckworth, 1977) contains an informative overview of the baritone's career, an assessment of his musical importance and a brief discussion of his recordings. </doc> <doc id="2340416" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340416" title="Castruccio Castracani"> Castruccio Castracani Castruccio Castracani degli Antelminelli (1281 – 3 September 1328) was an Italian "condottiero" and duke of Lucca. Castruccio was born in Lucca, a member of the noble family of Antelminelli, of the Ghibelline party. In 1300 he was exiled with his parents and others of their faction by the Guelphs "Black" party, then in the ascendant. At nineteen he became orphaned, and subsequently served as a "condottiero" under Philip IV of France in Flanders, then with the Visconti in Lombardy, and in 1313 under the Ghibelline chief, Uguccione della Faggiuola, lord of Pisa, in central Italy. He assisted Uguccione in many enterprises, including the capture of Lucca (1314) and the Battle of Montecatini (1315), in which he was the main protagonist of the victory over the Guelph League led by the Florentines. However, due to his growing popularity, Uguccione had him jailed and condemned to death. An insurrection of the Lucchesi having led to the expulsion of Uguccione and his party, Castruccio regained his freedom and his position, and the Ghibelline triumph was presently assured. Elected lord (as lifelong consul) of Lucca on 12 June 1316, he warred incessantly against the Florentines, though at home he renovated the Ponte della Maddalena, spanning the river Serchio. At first he was the faithful adviser and staunch supporter of Frederick of Austria, who made him imperial vicar of Lucca, Lunigiana and Val di Nievole in 1320. After the Battle of Mühldorf he went over to the emperor Louis the Bavarian, whom he served for many years. In 1325 he defeated the Florentines at the battle of Altopascio, and was appointed by the emperor duke of Lucca, Pistoia, Volterra and Luni; two years later he captured Pisa, of which he was made imperial vicar. But, subsequently, his relations with Louis seem to have grown less friendly and he was afterwards excommunicated by the papal legate in the interests of the Guelphs (1327). At his death in 1328 the fortunes of his young children were wrecked in the Guelph triumph. Niccolò Machiavelli wrote a "Life of Castruccio Castracani". It is understood to be fictional in many places, and based upon classical aphorisms. It was made later in his life than some of Machiavelli's more well known works and is thought by some commentators such as Leo Strauss to be significant for the understanding of Machiavelli's political philosophy. Mary Shelley's novel "Valperga; or, The Life and Adventures of Castruccio, Prince of Lucca", published in 1823, is based on the life of Castruccio Castracani, though the dates are slightly changed. </doc> <doc id="2340420" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340420" title="EagleBank Arena"> EagleBank Arena The EagleBank Arena (originally the Patriot Center) is a 10,000-seat arena in the eastern United States, on the campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, a suburb southwest of Washington, D.C. Opened in 1985, it is the home of Patriot men's & women's basketball, and is a venue for concerts and family shows, with of space. EagleBank Arena has attracted 9.6 million people to over 2,958 events to GMU, which has over 30,000 students. In 2010, the Patriot Center was ranked No. 7 nationwide and No. 12 worldwide according to ticket sales for venues with capacities between 10,001 and 15,000 by trade publication "Venues Today". Also in 2010, the Patriot Center was ranked No. 8 nationwide and No. 18 worldwide according to top grossing venues with a capacity between 10,001 and 15,000 by "Billboard" magazine. On May 7, 2015, the university announced that the name would be changed on July 1 to "EagleBank Arena at George Mason University", following a partnership deal with EagleBank. The Patriot Center is the first university venue to be managed by a private company, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, who also owns and manages Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. Financing for the construction of the Patriot Center was part of GMU's revenue bond package approved by the Virginia General Assembly in 1982. It replaced a 3,000-seat gymnasium. The first use of the Patriot Center was GMU's graduation ceremonies in May 1985. The official opening of the arena was on October 4, 1985, when the New York Knicks played the Washington Bullets in a pre-season game, debuting the first game of future Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Patrick Ewing. In 1990, the NCAA Men's Volleyball Championships were held at the Patriot Center. In 1986, the Patriot Center hosted the first men's CAA (Colonial Athletic Association) Tournament and hosted its first women's CAA Tournament in 2005. The Patriots have amassed an overall record of 220–92 at the Patriot Center. The Patriots are also 85–10 in the Patriot Center against Colonial Athletic Association opponents. During the 2010–2011 men's NCAA basketball season, the Patriots amassed a perfect 13–0 home record, which was the second time that occurred in three seasons. The arena underwent a $10 million renovation, completed in 2009, that added new concession stands, hospitality area, locker rooms and bathrooms, and an improved main concourse. From its opening, the Patriot Center was managed by Abe Pollin's Washington Sports, later renamed to Washington Sports & Entertainment. In May 1999, Pollin sold 40% of Washington Sports to a partnership led by Ted Leonsis as part of a $200 million deal that also saw Leonsis purchase the Washington Capitals hockey team. Leonsis' group increased their ownership of Washington Sports to 44% when they bought out minority owner Arnold Heft in January 2000. Following Pollin's death in 2009, Leonsis purchased the rest of WSE from Pollin's heirs in 2010, and consolidated Washington Sports & Entertainment with his own Lincoln Holdings company to form Monumental Sports & Entertainment. Management of the Patriot Center passed to this successor company. On February 4, 2012, GMU men's basketball debuted a new center court scoreboard and set an attendance record against Old Dominion University on homecoming, which then was reached again against James Madison University; both games were won by double digits. The Patriot Center also graduates many students of nearby Northern Virginia high schools. The Patriot Center hosted the sold-out on January 11, 2010. That was the first time that the UFC had staged an event in the state of Virginia. The arena also hosted a couple of games for the 2018 JBA season, despite not having a team representing the state of Virginia.

October 19, 2012), better known as Mike Graham, was an American professional wrestler. The son of wrestler and promoter Eddie Graham, Gossett was born in Tampa, Florida. Mike Graham was a Florida high school wrestling District champion his senior year in 1969 for Robinson High School (In Tampa, Florida). In the District finals, to qualify for state, he faced Richard Blood and beat him by one point. Blood, who was a sophomore at the time, would win the state title himself two years later. Blood went on to gain success and fame in professional wrestling as Ricky "The Dragon" Steamboat. Michael Gossett started wrestling in 1972 in his father's Championship Wrestling from Florida, which was a National Wrestling Alliance territory. He was trained by his father, Boris Malenko and Hiro Matsuda. He teamed with his father upon his arrival but also formed a successful team with Kevin Sullivan. Sullivan eventually turned on him to form his "Satanic cult", The Army of Darkness. Graham then teamed with Steve Keirn and Barry Windham to feud with them and to capture several tag team titles over the years. In 1981, Graham wrestled in the American Wrestling Association and feuded with Buck Zumhofe over the AWA Light Heavyweight Championship over the next two years. Graham headed back to Florida in 1983 primarily as a singles wrestlers. He started teaming with Keirn again in the late 1980s and wrestled in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions with Keirn briefly around this time. He then went back to the AWA in 1988 where he won the Light Heavyweight Title again. In 1988, Mike Graham & Steve Keirn wrestled in Memphis as a tag team. In 1989, he went back to Florida to the newly renamed Florida Championship Wrestling and teamed briefly with Dustin Rhodes. By 1990, Graham was an infrequent in-ring competitor and he became a road agent for World Championship Wrestling. Along with Paul Orndorff, Pez Whatley and DeWayne Bruce, Graham worked as a trainer in WCW as part of the WCW Power Plant. At Slamboree 1993, Mike represented his father when he was inducted into the WCW Hall of Fame. In the early 2000s, Graham was a road agent for the short-lived Xcitement Wrestling Federation and for Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling. He made occasional appearances for the revived Florida Championship Wrestling. Mike Graham worked with World Wrestling Entertainment in early 2006 on a DVD about Dusty Rhodes, which was released on June 6, 2006. He has appeared on WWE 24/7's Legends of Wrestling series as part of a panel which discussed famous pro wrestlers of the 1980s. He hosted classic episodes of Championship Wrestling from Florida on WWE 24/7 Classics. In March 2012, Graham teamed with long-time friend and tag-team partner Brian Blair, Lanny Poffo and Carlós Colon to defeat the team of Ron Bass, Larry Zbyszko, The Masked Superstar, and Gary Royal in an eight-man tag team elimination match at a Pro Wrestling Superstars at an event which featured former Championship Wrestling from Florida talent. Graham's father was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008. Mike represented his late father at the ceremony and the following night at WrestleMania XXIV. In addition to his wrestling career, Graham also competed in offshore power boat racing. In 1993, Graham throttled Kiely Motorsports' 35' Offshore Class C catamaran to multiple championship finishes: Graham maintained position as the throttle man for each finish. Graham elevated the profile of powerboat racing nationally and was known as a fierce competitor and a true sportsman. On October 19, 2012, Graham was found dead by his wife of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head at their residence in Daytona Beach, Florida. His father & son had committed suicide in similar manners on January 21, 1985 and December 14, 2010, respectively. His grandfather & uncle also committed suicide. His uncle was sick with cancer at the time. </doc> <doc id="2340440" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340440" title="Propp"> Propp Propp is a surname.

The "Abhidhamma Pitaka" is a detailed scholastic analysis and summary of the Buddha's teachings in the "Suttas". Here the "suttas" are reworked into a schematized system of general principles that might be called 'Buddhist Psychology'. In the "Abhidhamma" the generally dispersed teachings and principles of the suttas are organized into a coherent science of Buddhist doctrine. The other two collections are the Sutta Pitaka and the Vinaya Pitaka. Tradition holds that the Buddha thought out the Abhidhamma immediately after his enlightenment then taught it to the gods some years later. Later the Buddha repeated it to Sariputta who then handed it on to his disciples. This tradition is also evident in the Parivara, a very late addition to the Vinaya Pitaka, which mentions in a concluding verse of praise to the Buddha that "this best of creatures, the lion, taught the three pitakas". Scholars, however, generally date the Abhidhamma works to originating some time around the third century BCE, 100 to 200 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore, the seven Abhidhamma works are generally claimed by scholars not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, but those of disciples and scholars. Rupert Gethin however said that important elements of Abhidhamma methodology probably go back to the Buddha's lifetime. A. K. Warder and Peter Harvey both suggested early dates for the matikas on which most of the Abidhamma books are based. Abhidhamma started out as elaboration of the suttas, but later developed independent doctrines. As the last major division of the canon, the Abhidhamma Pitaka has had a checkered history. It was not accepted as canonical by the Mahasanghika school and several other schools. Another school included most of the Khuddaka Nikaya within the Abhidhamma Pitaka. Also, the Pali version of the Abhidhamma is a strictly Theravada collection, and has little in common with the Abhidhamma works recognized by other Buddhist schools. The various Abhidhamma philosophies of the various early schools have no agreement on doctrine and belong to the period of 'Divided Buddhism' (as opposed to Undivided Buddhism). The earliest texts of the Pali Canon have no mention of (the texts of) the Abhidhamma Pitaka. The Abhidhamma is also not mentioned in some reports of the First Buddhist Council, which do mention the existence of the texts of the Vinaya and either the five Nikayas or the four Agamas, although it may be noted that the Venerable [Sariputta] foremost in Abhidhamma had passed on before the Buddha, before the First Council took place. Other accounts do include the Abhidhamma. In the Theravadin Abhidhamma Pitaka, unlike the Abhidharma Pitaka of the Sarvastivada school, ontological theorizing is absent, and the question of ontological status of dharmas remains a moot point. The notion of "sabhava" (Sanskrit: "svabhava") is only utilized in late Theravadin texts. The doctrine of momentariness is also a late addition to Theravada thought. It only appears at the time of Buddhaghosa. The Abhidhamma Piṭaka consists of seven books: The Dhammasangani ("Summary of Dharma") is a manual of ethics for monks. It begins with a mātikā (translated as matrix) which lists classifications of dhammas (translated as phenomena, ideas, states, etc.). The mātikā starts with 22 threefold classifications, such as good/bad/unclassified, and then follows with 100 twofold classifications according to the Abhidhamma method. Many of these classifications are not exhaustive, and some are not even exclusive. The mātikā ends with 42 twofold classifications according to the sutta method; these 42 are only used in the Dhammasangani, whereas the other 122 are used in some of the other books as well. The main body of the Dhammasangani is in four parts. The first part goes through numerous states of mind, listing and defining by lists of synonyms, factors present in the states. The second deals with material form, beginning with its own mātikā, classifying by ones, twos and so on, and explaining afterwards. The third explains the book's mātikā in terms of the first two parts, as does the fourth, by a different method (and omitting the sutta method). The Vibhanga ("Division" or "Classification") consists of 18 chapters, each dealing with a different topic. For example, the first chapter deals with the five aggregates. A typical chapter consists of three parts. The first of these parts explains the topic according to the sutta method, often word-for-word as in actual suttas. The second is Abhidhamma explanation, mainly by lists of synonyms as in the Dhammasangani. The third employs questions and answers, based on the mātikā, such as "How many aggregates are good?" The Dhatukatha ("Discussion of Elements") covers both the matika and various topics, mostly from the Vibhanga, relating them to the 5 aggregates, 12 bases and 18 elements. The first chapter is fairly simple: "In how many aggregates etc. are good dhammas etc. included?" The book progressively works up to more complicated questions: "From how many aggregates etc. are the dhammas dissociated from attention etc. dissociated?" The Puggalapannatti ("Designation of Person") starts with its own matika, which begins with some standard lists but then continues with lists of persons grouped numerically from ones to tens. This latter portion of the matika is then explained in the main body of the work. It lists human characteristics encountered on the stages of a Buddhist path. Most of the lists of persons and many of the explanations are also found in the Anguttara Nikaya. The Kathavatthu ("Points of Controversy") consists of more than two hundred debates on questions of doctrine. The questions are heretical in nature, and are answered in such a way as to refute them. It starts with the question of whether or not a soul exists. It does not identify the participants. The commentary says the debates are between the Theravada and other schools, which it identifies in each case. These identifications are mostly consistent with what is known from other sources about the doctrines of different schools. It is the only portion attributed to a specific author, Moggaliputta. The Yamaka ("Pairs") consists of ten chapters, each dealing with a different topic; for example, the first deals with roots. A typical chapter (there are a number of divergences from this pattern) is in three parts. The first part deals with questions of identity: "Is good root root?" "But is root good root?" The entire Yamaka consists of such pairs of converse questions, with their answers. Hence its name, which means pairs. The second part deals with arising: "For someone for whom the form aggregate arises, does the feeling aggregate arise?" The third part deals with understanding: "Does someone who understands the eye base understand the ear base?" In essence, it is dealing with psychological phenomena. Patthan ("Activations" or "Causes") deals with 24 conditions in relation to the matika: "Good dhamma is related to good dhamma by root condition", with details and numbers of answers. This Patthana text comprise many cause and effects theory detail expositions, limitation and unlimitation of to their direction depended nature with ultimate. The importance of the Abhidhamma Pitaka in classical Sinhalese Buddhism is suggested by the fact that it came to be furnished, not only, like much of the canon, with a commentary and a subcommentary on that commentary, but even with a subsubcommentary on that subcommentary. In more recent centuries, Burma has become the main centre of Abhidhamma studies. However, all of Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka hold it in high regard. The first five books and part of the seventh of the Abhidhamma Pitaka have been translated by the Pali Text Society, which offers an option to order them through their website. </doc> <doc id="2340459" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340459" title="Allochtoon"> Allochtoon Allochtoon (plural: allochtonen) is a Dutch word (from Greek ἀλλόχθων, from ἄλλος ["allos"] other and χθών ["chthōn"] soil/earth/land), literally meaning "emerging from another soil". It is the opposite of the word "autochtoon" (in English "autochthonous" or "autochthon"; from Greek αὐτόχθων, from αὐτός ["autos"] self/same and again χθών [chthōn] soil/earth/land), literally meaning "emerging from this soil". In the Netherlands (and Flanders), the term "allochtoon" was widely used to refer to immigrants and their descendants. Officially the term "allochtoon" was much more specific and referred to anyone who had at least one parent born outside the Netherlands. The antonym "autochtoon" was less widely used, but it roughly corresponded to "ethnic Dutch". Among a number of immigrant groups living in the Netherlands, a ""Dutch"" person (though they are themselves Dutch citizens) usually refers to the ethnic Dutch. In 1950, Dutch descent, Dutch nationality, and Dutch citizenship were in practice identical. Dutch society consisted mostly of ethnic Dutch, with some colonial influences and sizeable minorities of German and Flemish heritage. In 1950, most Dutch were either Catholic or Protestant, with some atheists. Decolonisation and immigration from the 1960s on altered the ethnic and religious composition of the country. This development has made the 'ethnicity' and national identity of the Dutch a political issue. Dutch nationality law is based primarily on the principle of jus sanguinis ("right of blood"). In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Dutch parent, irrespective of place of birth. The Dutch Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek (CBS) used the definition that at least one of the parents is not born in the Netherlands. A first distinction was made between first-generation and second-generation newcomers. Note that someone who was born abroad, but with both parents born in the Netherlands, was an "autochtoon". A further distinction was made between "Western" and "non-Western" "allochtoon" people. A non-Western "allochtoon" was someone whose 'country of origin' was or lied in Turkey, Africa, Latin America and Asia, with the exception of Indonesia (or the former Dutch East Indies) and Japan. This last distinction was made because the official definition of "allochtoon" deviated from the common use in popular speech, where people referred to someone as "allochtoon" only when that person was an immigrant or an asylum seeker who was clearly distinct in ethnicity, clothing or behaviour from the traditional Dutch society. However, in the official sense, the largest group of "allochtoon" people were of German ancestry. The groups that people usually thought of when they heard the word "allochtoon" were those of Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Dutch-Antillean ancestry. As of 2006, the first three groups comprise roughly 350,000 people each, together constituting just over 6% of the population. So a new term was introduced that lied closer to that meaning, "niet-westers "allochtoon"", which excluded "allochtoon" people from Europe, Japan (a developed high income country) and Indonesia (a former colony), but not those from the Netherlands Antilles and Suriname, even though the Netherlands Antilles are part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and those from Suriname immigrated when that country was still part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This definition coincided better with the popular conception of the word as signifying people of low socio-economic status who are "different from us". Although some viewed the usage of "allochtoon" as a stigma, several members of the Dutch Royal Family were officially "allochtoon" people, as one of the parents was foreign-born. This included 'western-allochtoon' current monarch Willem Alexander, as well as his 'non-western allochtoon' wife Queen Máxima of the Netherlands and their children. As of November 1, 2016, the Statistics Netherlands stopped using the terms "allochtoon" and "autochtoon". Instead, it distinguishes people with a migrant background and people with a Dutch background. Originally proposed as a neutral term, the use of the term "allochtoon" has been criticized as being stigmatizing. There is a regular stream of newspaper articles reporting statistics that unfavourably distinguish "allochtoon" people from the rest of the Dutch. In 2013, the city council of Amsterdam decided to stop using the term because of its divisive effect. As of 2016, the term "allochtoon" is no longer used by the Dutch government. </doc> <doc id="2340464" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340464" title="Kennedy Approach"> Kennedy Approach Kennedy Approach is an air traffic control simulation computer game released by MicroProse for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 in 1985. It was designed by Andy Hollis. Ports for the Amiga and Atari ST were published in 1988. The player assumes the role of a controller in a Terminal Radar Approach Control, giving instructions to aircraft so that they can safely land, as well as take off and enter their correct flight corridors. The purpose of the game is to manage the flights that are presented to the player without the flights being delayed or exiting/landing in the wrong location. The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off. The aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix. To start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash. There are five airspaces in the game: Three types of aircraft are presented in the game: Four airlines are depicted in the game: In both the Atari and C64 versions, the conversations between the controller and the aircraft are read out on the TV loudspeaker. Although they are quite ritualized and formal, and the blocks of words which make up the orders are clearly distinguishable, synthesized speech was an impressive feat for home computers that averaged fewer than 64 kilobytes of available RAM. "Compute!" stated that "the sweat on your palms when you play "Kennedy Approach" is quite real", and approved of the documentation. It concluded that the game "is a fascinating, well-designed simulation for someone who wants to get a taste of what air traffic controllers do all day (and night) ... "Kennedy Approach" gets a clammy hands rating of 9 out of a possible 10". </doc> <doc id="2340466" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340466" title="Neuse Correctional Institution"> Neuse Correctional Institution Neuse Correctional Institution is a minimum-security state prison for men in the United States, operated by the State of North Carolina Department of Public Safety, Division of Adult Correction, Prisons Section in Goldsboro in Wayne County. Housing 816 prisoners, Neuse Correctional Institution, received its first inmates on August 27, 1994. Neuse was built to replace Triangle Correctional Center in Raleigh as the eastern North Carolina processing center for adult male misdemeanants. The original 500-bed construction project was authorized in July 1992 with a budget of $10.6 million, and another 100-bed dormitory was added to the construction program in July 1993. Neuse Correctional Institution serves as the point of entry into the prison system for adult male misdemeanant offenders from all counties. An amended mission is to process felons with sentences less than 24 months. The prison has been designed to provide 512 beds for inmates going through the diagnostic process. All male inmates were transferred out of Neuse Correctional Institution in early 2018 and the facility was converted to house female inmates transferring from Eastern Correctional Institution in Maury, NC and Southern Correctional Institution in Troy, NC. Those units are in the process of being converted to house close custody male inmates.

The European bee-eater occurs in Britain mainly as a spring overshoot. Until the late 20th century the species was a national rarity i.e. a species whose records are collected by the British Birds Rarities Committee. Increasing numbers meant that it was downgraded to a "scarce migrant" from 1991. Bee-eaters are occasionally seen in Britain in autumn, but are much scarcer at that season. The species has occasionally bred. European bee-eaters have attempted to nest on six known occasions in Britain: Eight sightings of the blue-cheeked bee-eater have been recorded. All individuals were adults, and all but one occurred in mid-summer. One occurrence of the white-fronted bee-eater has been recorded, as an escape from captivity. The northern carmine bee-eater has also occurred when one spent 24 May 2002 at Mundesley, Norfolk. No doubt of captive origin, it behaved in a wild manner and easily caught plenty of insects.

Influenced by his mother’s tapes of Pavarotti and the Three Tenors, Ansell joined the West Sussex Boys' Choir conducted by Arthur Robson, at the age of eight. He toured extensively with the choir to Florida, Germany, and France, performed in the Royal Festival Hall and sang many times in Arundel Cathedral. Ansell stayed with the choir until his voice broke at the age of 16 when he lost the ability to sing treble but after puberty found he had developed a high tenor voice instead. After a performance of "Love Changes Everything" at a choral society concert in Littlehampton, Ansell's local MP Howard Flight, who was in the audience, arranged for him to have a preliminary audition at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London. Ansell suffered from Glandular Fever from early September 1999 to mid-February 2000, and so the audition was rearranged. After working with music teacher Martin Elliott, he won a place at the Guildhall two years later. While at the Guildhall School, Ansell's singing teacher was Adrian Thompson, who has a similar voice to Ansell and he described their lessons as working together. At that time, Ansell's academic studies fell below the standard. Diagnosed as dyslexic, an agreement was reached where he stayed as a pupil. While at the Guildhall School, Ansell formed the pop-opera boyband G4 with three other students Mike Christie, Tom Lowe, and Ben Thapa. Lowe later resigned as bass, replaced by Matthew Stiff. Their name, G4, stands for Guildhall 4. G4 were discovered after finishing second on ITV talent show The X Factor in 2004. G4's self-titled debut album produced by Trevor Horn and Brian Rawling, reached Number One for Mother's Day weekend 2005. In total they released 3 albums, sold in excess of 1.5 million albums in the UK, completed 5 sell-out UK tours, sold in excess of 40,000 "Live at the Royal Albert Hall" DVDs (one of the concerts on their first tour) and also released a best-selling autobiography "Our Way". Ansell turned down the role of Prince Tamino in Kenneth Branagh's film of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" to stay with the band and continue recording. On 5 April 2007, G4 announced on GMTV that they were calling it a day at the end of July 2007. On 17 November 2014 G4 reformed for 'one night only' giving a concert at The Barbican Centre in London to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of their X Factor appearance in 2004. Whilst on stage Jonathan announced that due to the response of their 'one night only' concert they would be doing a UK tour in 2015. Ansell signed with new management Jonathan Shalit in 2007 and secured a £1 million, 5-album deal with Universal Classics and Jazz (UCJ), part of Universal Music Group. His first solo album with UCJ, "Tenor at the Movies", was released on 18 February 2008. For five Sunday afternoons from 17 February 2008, Ansell presented "The Great Movie Composers" on ClassicFM coinciding with the release of his solo album. Ansell participated in a celebrity edition of Channel 4 show "Come Dine with Me" on 10 April 2008 with MC Harvey, Tamara Beckwith and Lynsey de Paul. Ansell came in joint first place with MC Harvey, scoring 21 points. On 8 May 2008, Ansell's participation in BBC programme "Ready Steady Cook" against Hayley Westenra was broadcast. In the evening of 8 May 2008, Ansell performed "Un Giorno Per Noi" with Westenra at the Classical Brits, Royal Albert Hall. During June 2008, Ansell and England and Arsenal striker Kelly Smith won the British Lung Foundation's male and female 'Lungs of the Year 2008' award in recognition of the fantastic use they have made of their lungs over the past year. In a Q&A session with the BBC's "Last Choir Standing" website, Ansell gave his views on the benefits of being part of a choir: "People see choirs on stage and predominantly it looks quite square... but off stage that's where all the fun happens - in rehearsals, messing about, lunch breaks, interacting with new people. That, for me, is what choirs are all about – having that fun both on and off stage." Jonathan made a guest appearance on "Last Choir Standing" (Results Show) on 3 August 2008 performing "Barcelona". On Sunday, 17 August 2008, Ansell participated in the tribute concert "Lyrics by Don Black" which was held at the London Palladium featuring performances of Black's songs by a selection of guest artists. He performed the duet "Amigos Para Siempre" with Westenra, music by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The evening, hosted by Michael Parkinson, was recorded by BBC Radio 2 Friday Night is Music Night and broadcast on Friday, 22 August 2008. One of the tracks on his second album "Forever" is "Hearts of England", the 2008 Rugby League World Cup song composed by Patrick Hawes and his brother Andrew. He performed it live at the Rugby League Carnegie Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday, 30 August 2008. For the second weekend running Ansell performed a track from his album "Forever" live at Wembley, this time to sing the football anthem "Nessun Dorma" at Soccer Aid on Sunday, 7 September while the teams were presented to Sir Geoff Hurst. Before his G4 days, Ansell worked in Jersey with a Gilbert and Sullivan operatic society and during September 2008 returned to his roots, taking on the role of Nanki-Poo in the Carl Rosa Opera Company's production of "The Mikado" at both the Richmond Theatre and Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham. Ansell performed with Westenra at "Music on Fire"! at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in September 2008, organised by the Army Benevolent Fund to raise funds for veterans. The third series of "The Alan Titchmarsh Show" featured the start of a competition to find a soprano to sing with Ansell in the "A Night At The Opera" tour. 8 ladies were selected to sing in front of a judging panel of David Grant, Ruthie Henshall and Jonathan Shalit. The 4 successful ladies Rosie Bell, Rosie Havel, Olivia Safe and Esther Dee faced a public vote on 15 September 2008 and Olivia Safe and Rosie Bell won through. They sang "Libiamo ne' lieti calici" with Ansell, from Verdi's "La Traviata" on 29 September 2008. Olivia Safe won the public vote to appear in the tour of "A Night At the Opera". "A Night At the Opera" had its first performance at the Cardiff Millennium Centre on 30 October 2008 and toured 18 venues in the UK ending at the London Palladium on 23 November 2008. The show co-starred Silvia Colloca, Telman Guzhevsky, Anna-Clare Monk, Toby Stafford Allen and Olivia Safe. On Saturday, 8 November 2008, Ansell performed "Today Won't Come Again" with Westenra at the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall and later sang "Here's to the Heroes" when the returning forces came into the auditorium. During February 2009, Ansell toured with Westenra in "The Valentines Tour". At the England versus Scotland Six Nations Rugby Match at Twickenham on 21 March 2009, Ansell sang "God Save the Queen" at Twickenham. During Easter Week, 7 April 2009, Jonathan appeared in Dictionary Corner on Channel 4's "Countdown". Ansell was nominated for the Classical Brits 2009 "Album of the Year" with "Tenor at the Movies". On Monday 30 November 2009, Ansell launched the "This Morning"'s Christmas Choir. In 2010, Ansell made his musical theatre début as The Man in the Bill Kenwright touring production of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman's "Whistle Down The Wind". Opening at the Liverpool Empire on 20 January, Ansell performed eight shows a week during the eight month UK tour. Ansell played Boemer and two other characters in the 2010 National Tour of "Lark Rise to Candleford" starting at the Theatre Royal Windsor in September 2010. In April and May 2011, Ansell played the role of the Prince/Beast in a national tour of "Beauty and the Beast".. In June 2011, he toured the UK with the show "Jonathan Ansell and Friends". Ansell unsuccessfully auditioned for the lead role in the Andrew Lloyd Webber production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 2012, as part of ITV's "Superstar" TV talent contest. In January 2012, Ansell launched a new album project, a mix of pop/rock covers and classics. The Album "Two Hearts" was released on 14 October 2013. Ansell teamed up with "Rhydian Roberts" on a 32 date tour of "Les Musicals" in May, June and October. Due to the success of the tour it was announced that the duo would be touring another show of 'Les Musicals' in 2019 as well as releasing an album together via PledgeMusic Ansell has long been a supporter of Breast Cancer Care because his father's twin sister, Brenda, died from the condition. He participated in the London Triathlon in 2007, performed at their London Fashion Show and Carols by Candlelight Service as well as donating his winnings from Who Wants to be Millionaire and Come Dine with Me. In April 2009, Ansell was appointed as an Ambassador for the charity Breast Cancer Care. In October 2008, Ansell and Westenra sold poppies at Waterloo station to support the Royal British Legion. On 12 November, Ansell duet "Today Won't Come Again" with Westenra in the Annual Festival of Remembrance. Ansell was the benchmark flyer for the Worthing International Birdman challenge where contestants attempt mechanically unaided flight off the end of Worthing Pier. He managed , sporting a Mr Incredible-style pink hairdo. After meeting in a London night club, Ansell proposed to former "Quizmania" host Debbie King on stage at the end of his final show of "A Night at the Opera" at the London Palladium on 23 November 2008. The couple married on Sunday 30 August 2009 on the 40th floor of 30 St Mary Axe. On 14 May 2010, the couple announced they were expecting their first child. King gave birth at 2 pm on 24 November 2010 to a daughter. On 16 September 2014 Jonathan announced on his Official Facebook page 'Its a Boy!!!. Confirming the birth of their second child at 3pm. </doc> <doc id="2340475" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340475" title="Benveniste"> Benveniste Benveniste, is the surname, byname (see below - the origin of the name) of an old, noble, rich, and scholarly Jewish family of Narbonne, France and northern Spain from the 11th century. The family was present in the 11th to the 15th centuries in Provence, France, Barcelona, Aragon and Castile' Spain. Family members received honorary titles from the authorities and were members of the administration of the kingdom of Aragon and Castile. They were the Baillie ("Bayle") - the Tax Officer and Treasurer, Alfaquim - Senior Advisor to the King and Royal Physician in Barcelona and Aragon in the 12th and 13th centuries. They held the title of "Nasi" (prince in Hebrew), since they are considered by the Jewish tradition as descendents of King David and members of the House of David in the Jewish communities (mainly Barcelona) and were prominent religious and secular leaders in the 11th to the 14th centuries. In the 14th to the 15th century they held the titles of ""Benveniste de la Cavalleria""—"of the knights" (a name given by the Knights Templar to their treasurers and tax collectors) and Don—a noble person in Aragon and Castile. In the aftermath of the great massacres of Jews which began in Spain on 6 June 1391 some such as the de Cartagena family converted to Christianity and became powerful conversos in Burgos. After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492 non-converts were dispersed mainly to Portugal, Greece - Salonica other parts of the Turkish Empire and North African countries. In Portugal they were forced to convert to Christianity in 1497 and became some of the richest traders and bankers (the Mendes family) of Europe. Today the name is borne by families in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Israel. It was also used as a prænomen. The origin of the name according to a family legend told to David Benvenisti, a prominent Israeli scholar, by his grandfather Shemuel Yosef Benvenisti, a prominent Jewish leader in Salonica, in the beginning of the 20th century is: "When our forbearers dwelt in Spain, one of the kings had a Jewish finance minister who also served as royal physician. He was also known as an expert in flora, particularly medicinal plants. Once, the king, accompanied by his Jewish minister, went for a stroll in the fields near the palace. The minister told the king about every plant. The king was especially fascinated by the malva and its pink and violet blossoms. When the king asked what the flower was called and what it was used for, the Jewish minister replied that its petals were cooked and eaten, and it was called "bienva." At this time one of the ministers, a sworn enemy of the Jewish minister, burst into laughter, and said to the king: "Your Majesty, that Jew-minister expert in our country's flora was making fun of you. He deliberately gave you a wrong name for that flower in order to embarrass you before your ministers and viziers. That is not a ‘bienva,’ but a ‘malva’." The king angrily asked the Jewish minister to explain, threatening him with dire punishment. The minister said: "Your Majesty, I am ready to accept your judgment. But first, I beg you, hear me out carefully. Your Majesty, when we were out in the field, you asked me to tell you the name of that plant. There you were, standing before me, Royal Highness, and I thought: By no means am I going to offend Your Majesty by telling you the plant's true name, ‘malva’ – ‘ill-going’! So I told you that the plant is called ‘bienva’ ‘well-going’!”. The king was mollified, and he said to the Jewish minister: “You have vanquished those of my ministers who wish you ill. I am pleased with your explanation. And to commemorate this occasion, I hereby; dub you bien veniste (‘Benveniste’) or 'your arrival was for good'”. Yet, the above nice legend does not take into account the fact that in medieval Iberia, before being used as a surname, Benveniste (from the Spanish expression meaning ‘welcome!’) was used by Jews as a given name. It was one of the votive names typical for medieval Jews in southwestern Europe: it expressed a wish for the child to be welcome in this world. As many other names based on father's given name (patronymics), it gradually became a hereditary family name. The first appearance of the name Benveniste was in the 11th century in southern France (Septimania, Provence of our time). The region was shaped by Charlemagne from the Frankish Kingdom of the Carolingian. The big Narbonne Jewish center was established, according to Jewish and Christian sources, by prominent Jews from Bagdad at the request of the Carolingian kings in the end of the first millennium AD. The Babylonian names of Makhir, Hasdai, Sheshet and Shealtiel are the names of chief rabbis and leaders - Nasi (considered by the Jewish tradition as descendents of King David) of the Jewish center. The Jewish families assisted the Christian administrations of the Kingdom of Aragon and the County of Barcelona as tax collectors and advisers. In 1150 Aragon and Barcelona were united by the marriage of their rulers. The Jewish families appear together with the name Benveniste in official and Jewish documents of Narbonne, Barcelona and Aragon from the 11th-13th century AD with the title Nasi added their names. They appear in the travel books of Benjamin of Tudela from the 12th century. </doc> <doc id="2340483" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340483" title="Respiration rate"> Respiration rate The respiration rate is a parameter which is used in ecological and agronomical modeling.

The museum contains an exhibit of collectors' autos from vintage to modern classics, with the main focus being American cars of the 1950–1980 period, TV and movie cars, bizarre cars, cars previously owned by the rich and famous, and a large, one-of-a-kind, Disney and Looney Tunes characters display. Unique to this museum is that many of the vehicles on display (in five large buildings) are for sale. One of 33 exhibits on the 25-acre museum campus is a military-oriented "Armed Forces Exhibit," added in the late 2000s. Of the 4 antique malls on the museum grounds, one is reported to be haunted and has become a magnet for ghost hunters and sightings and an episode of the TV show Ghost Lab. The museum has its own TV series on History called "Volo, House of Cars" beginning in 2017. The museum features cars (some original and many replicas) from notable television shows and movies.

The TGA is responsible for conducting assessment and monitoring activities to ensure that therapeutic goods available in Australia are of an acceptable standard and that access to therapeutic advances is in a timely manner. The TGA has nine statutory expert committees it may call upon to obtain independent advice on scientific and technical matters, including: The governments of Australia and New Zealand were working towards establishing a Trans-Tasman joint agency for the regulation of drugs and therapeutic goods to replace the TGA and New Zealand's Medsafe. However, on 16 July 2007, the New Zealand State Services Minister Annette King announced that "The Government is not proceeding at this stage with legislation that would have enabled the establishment of a joint agency with Australia to regulate therapeutic products". She further advised that "The [New Zealand] Government does not have the numbers in Parliament to put in place a sensible, acceptable compromise that would satisfy all parties at this time.

While various sub-groups of the virus acquired human infectivity at different times, the global pandemic had its origins in the emergence of one specific strain – HIV-1 subgroup M – in Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo (now Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in the 1920s. There are two types of HIV: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent, is more easily transmitted and is the cause of the vast majority of HIV infections globally. The pandemic strain of HIV-1 is closely related to a virus found in chimpanzees of the subspecies "Pan troglodytes troglodytes", which live in the forests of the Central African nations of Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo (or Congo-Brazzaville), and Central African Republic. HIV-2 is less transmittable and is largely confined to West Africa, along with its closest relative, a virus of the sooty mangabey ("Cercocebus atys atys"), an Old World monkey inhabiting southern Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and western Ivory Coast. The majority of HIV researchers agree that HIV evolved at some point from the closely related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and that SIV or HIV (post mutation) was transferred from non-human primates to humans in the recent past (as a type of zoonosis). Research in this area is conducted using molecular phylogenetics, comparing viral genomic sequences to determine relatedness. Scientists generally accept that the known strains (or groups) of HIV-1 are most closely related to the simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) endemic in wild ape populations of West Central African forests. In particular, each of the known HIV-1 strains is either closely related to the SIV that infects the chimpanzee subspecies "Pan troglodytes troglodytes" (SIVcpz) or closely related to the SIV that infects western lowland gorillas ("Gorilla gorilla gorilla"), called SIVgor. The pandemic HIV-1 strain (group M or Main) and a rare strain found only in a few Cameroonian people (group N) are clearly derived from SIVcpz strains endemic in "Pan troglodytes troglodytes" chimpanzee populations living in Cameroon. Another very rare HIV-1 strain (group P) is clearly derived from SIVgor strains of Cameroon. Finally, the primate ancestor of HIV-1 group O, a strain infecting 100,000 people mostly from Cameroon but also from neighboring countries, was confirmed in 2006, to be SIVgor. The pandemic HIV-1 group M is most closely related to the SIVcpz collected from the southeastern rain forests of Cameroon (modern East Province) near the Sangha River. Thus, this region is presumably where the virus was first transmitted from chimpanzees to humans. However, reviews of the epidemiological evidence of early HIV-1 infection in stored blood samples, and of old cases of AIDS in Central Africa, have led many scientists to believe that HIV-1 group M early human center was probably not in Cameroon, but rather farther south in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, more probably in its capital city, Kinshasa (formerly Léopoldville). Using HIV-1 sequences preserved in human biological samples along with estimates of viral mutation rates, scientists calculate that the jump from chimpanzee to human probably happened during the late 19th or early 20th century, a time of rapid urbanisation and colonisation in equatorial Africa. Exactly when the zoonosis occurred is not known. Some molecular dating studies suggest that HIV-1 group M had its most recent common ancestor (MRCA) (that is, started to spread in the human population) in the early 20th century, probably between 1915 and 1941. A study published in 2008, analyzing viral sequences recovered from a biopsy made in Kinshasa, in 1960, along with previously known sequences, suggested a common ancestor between 1873 and 1933 (with central estimates varying between 1902 and 1921). Genetic recombination had earlier been thought to "seriously confound" such phylogenetic analysis, but later "work has suggested that recombination is not likely to systematically bias [results]", although recombination is "expected to increase variance". The results of a 2008 phylogenetics study support the later work and indicate that HIV evolves "fairly reliably". Further research was hindered due to the primates being critically endangered. Sample analyses resulted in little data due to the rarity of experimental material. The researchers, however, were able to hypothesize a phylogeny from the gathered data. They were also able to use the molecular clock of a specific strain of HIV to determine the initial date of transmission, which is estimated to be around 1915–1931. Similar research has been undertaken with SIV strains collected from several wild sooty mangabey ("Cercocebus atys atys") (SIVsmm) populations of the West African nations of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Ivory Coast. The resulting phylogenetic analyses show that the viruses most closely related to the two strains of HIV-2 that spread considerably in humans (HIV-2 groups A and B) are the SIVsmm found in the sooty mangabeys of the Tai forest, in western Ivory Coast. There are six additional known HIV-2 groups, each having been found in just one person. They all seem to derive from independent transmissions from sooty mangabeys to humans. Groups C and D have been found in two people from Liberia, groups E and F have been discovered in two people from Sierra Leone, and groups G and H have been detected in two people from the Ivory Coast. These HIV-2 strains are probably dead-end infections, and each of them is most closely related to SIVsmm strains from sooty mangabeys living in the same country where the human infection was found. Molecular dating studies suggest that both the epidemic groups (A and B) started to spread among humans between 1905 and 1961 (with the central estimates varying between 1932 and 1945). According to the natural transfer theory (also called "hunter theory" or "bushmeat theory"), the "simplest and most plausible explanation for the cross-species transmission" of SIV or HIV (post mutation), the virus was transmitted from an ape or monkey to a human when a hunter or bushmeat vendor/handler was bitten or cut while hunting or butchering the animal. The resulting exposure to blood or other bodily fluids of the animal can result in SIV infection. Prior to WWII, some Sub-Saharan Africans were forced out of the rural areas because of the European demand for resources. Since rural Africans were not keen to pursue agricultural practices in the jungle, they turned to non-domesticated meat as their primary source of protein. This over-exposure to bushmeat and malpractice of butchery increased blood-to-blood contact, which then increased the probability of transmission. A recent serological survey showed that human infections by SIV are not rare in Central Africa: the percentage of people showing seroreactivity to antigens—evidence of current or past SIV infection—was 2.3% among the general population of Cameroon, 7.8% in villages where bushmeat is hunted or used, and 17.1% in the most exposed people of these villages. How the SIV virus would have transformed into HIV after infection of the hunter or bushmeat handler from the ape/monkey is still a matter of debate, although natural selection would favor any viruses capable of adjusting so that they could infect and reproduce in the T cells of a human host. A study published in 2009 also discussed that bushmeat in other parts of the world, such as Argentina, may be a possible location for where the disease originated. HIV-1C, a subtype of HIV, was theorized to have its origins circulating in South America. The consumption of bushmeat is also the most probable cause for the emergence of HIV-1C in South America. However, the types of apes shown to carry the SIV virus are different in South America. The primary point of entry, according to researchers, is somewhere in the jungles of Argentina or Brazil. An SIV strain, closely related to HIV, was interspersed within a certain clade of primates. This suggests that the zoonotic transmission of the virus may have happened in this area. Continual emigration between countries escalated the transmission of the virus. Other scientists believe that the HIV-1C strain circulated in South America at around the same time that the HIV-1C strain was introduced in Africa. Little research has been done on this theory because it is fairly young. The discovery of the main HIV / SIV phylogenetic relationships permits explaining "broad" HIV biogeography: the early centers of the HIV-1 groups were in Central Africa, where the primate reservoirs of the related SIVcpz and SIVgor viruses (chimpanzees and gorillas) exist; similarly, the HIV-2 groups had their centers in West Africa, where sooty mangabeys, which harbor the related SIVsmm virus, exist. However these relationships do not explain more detailed patterns of biogeography, such as why epidemic HIV-2 groups (A and B) only evolved in the Ivory Coast, which is one of only six countries harboring the sooty mangabey. It is also unclear why the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies "Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii" (inhabiting the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, and Tanzania) did not spawn an epidemic HIV-1 strain to humans, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was the main center of HIV-1 group M, a virus descended from SIVcpz strains of a subspecies ("Pan troglodytes troglodytes") that does not exist in this country. It is clear that the several HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains descend from SIVcpz, SIVgor, and SIVsmm viruses, and that bushmeat practice provides the most plausible venue for cross-species transfer to humans. However, some loose ends remain. It is not yet explained why only four HIV groups (HIV-1 groups M and O, and HIV-2 groups A and B) spread considerably in human populations, despite bushmeat practices being widespread in Central and West Africa, and the resulting human SIV infections being common. It also remains unexplained why all epidemic HIV groups emerged in humans nearly simultaneously, and only in the 20th century, despite very old human exposure to SIV (a recent phylogenetic study demonstrated that SIV is at least tens of thousands of years old). Several of the theories of HIV origin accept the established knowledge of the HIV/SIV phylogenetic relationships, and also accept that bushmeat practice was the most likely cause of the initial transfer to humans. All of them propose that the simultaneous epidemic emergences of four HIV groups in the late 19th-early 20th century, and the lack of previous known emergences, are explained by new factor(s) that appeared in the relevant African regions in that timeframe. These new factor(s) would have acted either to increase human exposures to SIV, to help it to adapt to the human organism by mutation (thus enhancing its between-humans transmissibility), or to cause an initial burst of transmissions crossing an epidemiological threshold, and therefore increasing the probability of continued spread. Genetic studies of the virus suggested in 2008 that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to the Belgian Congo city of Léopoldville (modern Kinshasa), circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of non-monogamous sexual activity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. In 2014, a study conducted by scientists from the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, revealed that because approximately one million people every year would flow through the prominent city of Kinshasa, which served as the origin of the first known HIV cases in the 1920s, passengers riding on the region's Belgian railway trains were able to spread the virus to larger areas. The study also attributed a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics as other factors which contributed to the emergence of the Africa HIV epidemic. Beatrice Hahn, Paul M. Sharp, and their colleagues proposed that "[the epidemic emergence of HIV] most likely reflects changes in population structure and behaviour in Africa during the 20th century and perhaps medical interventions that provided the opportunity for rapid human-to-human spread of the virus". After the Scramble for Africa started in the 1880s, European colonial powers established cities, towns, and other colonial stations. A largely masculine labor force was hastily recruited to work in fluvial and sea ports, railways, other infrastructures, and in plantations. This disrupted traditional tribal values and favored casual sexual activity with an increased number of partners. In the nascent cities women felt relatively liberated from rural tribal rules and many remained unmarried or divorced during long periods, this being rare in African traditional societies. This was accompanied by unprecedented increase in people's movements. Michael Worobey and colleagues observed that the growth of cities probably played a role in the epidemic emergence of HIV, since the phylogenetic dating of the two older strains of HIV-1 (groups M and O), suggest that these viruses started to spread soon after the main Central African colonial cities were founded. Amit Chitnis, Diana Rawls, and Jim Moore proposed that HIV may have emerged epidemically as a result of the harsh conditions, forced labor, displacement, and unsafe injection and vaccination practices associated with colonialism, particularly in French Equatorial Africa. The workers in plantations, construction projects, and other colonial enterprises were supplied with bushmeat, which would have contributed to an increase in hunting and, it follows, a higher incidence of human exposure to SIV. Several historical sources support the view that bushmeat hunting indeed increased, both because of the necessity to supply workers and because firearms became more widely available. The colonial authorities also gave many vaccinations against smallpox, and injections, of which many would be made without sterilising the equipment between uses (unsafe or unsterile injections). Chitnis "et al." proposed that both these parenteral risks and the prostitution associated with forced labor camps could have caused serial transmission (or serial passage) of SIV between humans (see discussion of this in the next section). In addition, they proposed that the conditions of extreme stress associated with forced labor could depress the immune system of workers, therefore prolonging the primary acute infection period of someone newly infected by SIV, thus increasing the odds of both adaptation of the virus to humans, and of further transmissions. The authors proposed that HIV-1 originated in the area of French Equatorial Africa in the early 20th century (when the colonial abuses and forced labor were at their peak). Later research established these theories were mostly correct: HIV-1 groups M and O started to spread in humans in late 19th–early 20th century. In addition, all groups of HIV-1 descend from either SIVcpz or SIVgor from apes living to the west of the Ubangi River, either in countries that belonged to the French Equatorial Africa federation of colonies, in Equatorial Guinea (then a Spanish colony), or in Cameroon (which was a German colony between 1884 and 1916, and then fell to Allied forces in World War I, and had most of its area administered by France, in close association with French Equatorial Africa). This theory was later dubbed "Heart of Darkness" by Jim Moore, alluding to the book of the same title written by Joseph Conrad, the main focus of which is colonial abuses in equatorial Africa. In several articles published since 2001, Preston Marx, Philip Alcabes, and Ernest Drucker proposed that HIV emerged because of rapid serial human-to-human transmission of SIV (after a bushmeat hunter or handler became SIV-infected) through unsafe or unsterile injections. Although both Chitnis "et al." and Sharp "et al." also suggested that this may have been one of the major risk factors at play in HIV emergence (see above), Marx "et al." enunciated the underlying mechanisms in greater detail, and wrote the first review of the injection campaigns made in colonial Africa. Central to Marx "et al." argument is the concept of adaptation by serial passage (or serial transmission): an adventitious virus (or other pathogen) can increase its biological adaptation to a new host species if it is rapidly transmitted between hosts, while each host is still in the acute infection period. This process favors the accumulation of adaptive mutations more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted viral variant will appear in the host before the immune system suppresses the virus. Such better adapted variant could then survive in the human host for longer than the short acute infection period, in high numbers (high viral load), which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread. Marx "et al." reported experiments of cross-species transfer of SIV in captive monkeys (some of which made by themselves), in which the use of serial passage helped to adapt SIV to the new monkey species after passage by three or four animals. In agreement with this model is also the fact that, while both HIV-1 and HIV-2 attain substantial viral loads in the human organism, adventitious SIV infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV viral load. This suggests that both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are adapted to humans, and serial passage could have been the process responsible for it. Marx "et al." proposed that unsterile injections (that is, injections where the needle or syringe is reused without sterilization or cleaning between uses), which were likely very prevalent in Africa, during both the colonial period and afterwards, provided the mechanism of serial passage that permitted HIV to adapt to humans, therefore explaining why it emerged epidemically only in the 20th century. Marx "et al." emphasize the massive number of injections administered in Africa after antibiotics were introduced (around 1950) as being the most likely implicated in the origin of HIV because, by these times (roughly in the period 1950 to 1970), injection intensity in Africa was maximal. They argued that a serial passage chain of 3 or 4 transmissions between humans is an unlikely event (the probability of transmission after a needle reuse is something between 0.3% and 2%, and only a few people have an acute SIV infection at any time), and so HIV emergence may have required the very high frequency of injections of the antibiotic era. The molecular dating studies place the initial spread of the epidemic HIV groups before that time (see above). According to Marx "et al.", these studies could have overestimated the age of the HIV groups, because they depend on a molecular clock assumption, may not have accounted for the effects of natural selection in the viruses, and the serial passage process alone would be associated with strong natural selection. David Gisselquist proposed that the mass injection campaigns to treat trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in Central Africa were responsible for the emergence of HIV-1. Unlike Marx "et al.", Gisselquist argued that the millions of unsafe injections administered during these campaigns were sufficient to spread rare HIV infections into an epidemic, and that evolution of HIV through serial passage was not essential to the emergence of the HIV epidemic in the 20th century. This theory focuses on injection campaigns that peaked in the period 1910–40, that is, around the time the HIV-1 groups started to spread. It also focuses on the fact that many of the injections in these campaigns were intravenous (which are more likely to transmit SIV/HIV than subcutaneous or intramuscular injections), and many of the patients received many (often more than 10) injections per year, therefore increasing the odds of SIV serial passage. Jacques Pépin and Annie-Claude Labbé reviewed the colonial health reports of Cameroon and French Equatorial Africa for the period 1921–59, calculating the incidences of the diseases requiring intravenous injections. They concluded that trypanosomiasis, leprosy, yaws, and syphilis were responsible for most intravenous injections. Schistosomiasis, tuberculosis, and vaccinations against smallpox represented lower parenteral risks: schistosomiasis cases were relatively few; tuberculosis patients only became numerous after mid-century; and there were few smallpox vaccinations in the lifetime of each person. The authors suggested that the very high prevalence of the Hepatitis C virus in southern Cameroon and forested areas of French Equatorial Africa (around 40–50%) can be better explained by the unsterile injections used to treat yaws, because this disease was much more prevalent than syphilis, trypanosomiasis, and leprosy in these areas. They suggested that all these parenteral risks caused not only the massive spread of Hepatitis C but also the spread of other pathogens, and the emergence of HIV-1: "the same procedures could have exponentially amplified HIV-1, from a single hunter/cook occupationally infected with SIVcpz to several thousand patients treated with arsenicals or other drugs, a threshold beyond which sexual transmission could prosper." They do not suggest specifically serial passage as the mechanism of adaptation. According to Pépin's 2011 book, "The Origins of AIDS", the virus can be traced to a central African bush hunter in 1921, with colonial medical campaigns using improperly sterilized syringe and needles playing a key role in enabling a future epidemic. Pépin concludes that AIDS spread silently in Africa for decades, fueled by urbanization and prostitution since the initial cross-species infection. Pépin also claims that the virus was brought to the Americas by a Haitian teacher returning home from Zaire in the 1960s. Sex tourism and contaminated blood transfusion centers ultimately propelled AIDS to public consciousness in the 1980s and a worldwide pandemic. João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme proposed that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, helped by a high frequency of genital ulcers, caused by genital ulcer diseases (GUD). GUD are simply sexually transmitted diseases that cause genital ulcers; examples are syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and genital herpes. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01–0.1% to 4–43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated T cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV. Sousa "et al." use molecular dating techniques to estimate the time when each HIV group split from its closest SIV lineage. Each HIV group necessarily crossed to humans between this time and the time when it started to spread (the time of the MRCA), because after the MRCA certainly all lineages were already in humans, and before the split with the closest simian strain, the lineage was in a simian. HIV-1 groups M and O split from their closest SIVs around 1931 and 1915, respectively. This information, together with the datations of the HIV groups' MRCAs, mean that all HIV groups likely crossed to humans in the early 20th century. The authors reviewed colonial medical articles and archived medical reports of the countries at or near the ranges of chimpanzees, gorillas and sooty mangabeys, and found that genital ulcer diseases peaked in the colonial cities during their early growth period (up to 1935). The colonial authorities recruited men to work in railways, fluvial and sea ports, and other infrastructure projects, and most of these men did not bring their wives with them. Then, the highly male-biased sex ratio favoured prostitution, which in its turn caused an explosion of GUD (especially syphilis and chancroid). After the mid-1930s, people's movements were more tightly controlled, and mass surveys and treatments (of arsenicals and other drugs) were organized, and so the GUD incidences started to decline. They declined even further after World War II, because of the heavy use of antibiotics, so that, by the late 1950s, Léopoldville (which is the probable center of HIV-1 group M) had a very low GUD incidence. Similar processes happened in the cities of Cameroon and Ivory Coast, where HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 respectively evolved. Therefore, the peak GUD incidences in cities have a good temporal coincidence with the period when all main HIV groups crossed to humans and started to spread. In addition, the authors gathered evidence that syphilis and the other GUDs were, like injections, absent from the densely forested areas of Central and West Africa before organized colonialism socially disrupted these areas (starting in the 1880s). Thus, this theory also potentially explains why HIV emerged only after the late 19th century. Uli Linke has argued that the practice of female genital mutilation (i.e., clitoridectomy and/or infibulation) is responsible for the high incidence of AIDS in Africa, since intercourse with a female who has undergone clitoridectomy is conducive to exchange of blood. Male circumcision may reduce the probability of HIV acquisition by men. Leaving aside blood transfusions, the highest HIV-1 transmissibility ever measured was from GUD-suffering female prostitutes to uncircumcised men—the measured risk was 43% in a single sexual act. Sousa "et al." reasoned that the adaptation and epidemic emergence of each HIV group may have required such extreme conditions, and thus reviewed the existing ethnographic literature for patterns of male circumcision and hunting of apes and monkeys for bushmeat, focusing on the period 1880–1960, and on most of the 318 ethnic groups living in Central and West Africa. They also collected censuses and other literature showing the ethnic composition of colonial cities in this period. Then, they estimated the circumcision frequencies of the Central African cities over time. Sousa "et al." charts reveal that male circumcision frequencies were much lower in several cities of western and central Africa in the early 20th century than they are currently. The reason is that many ethnic groups not performing circumcision by that time gradually adopted it, to imitate other ethnic groups and enhance the social acceptance of their boys (colonialism produced massive intermixing between African ethnic groups). About 15–30% of men in Léopoldville and Douala in the early 20th century should be uncircumcised, and these cities were the probable centers of HIV-1 groups M and O, respectively. The authors studied early circumcision frequencies in 12 cities of Central and West Africa, to test if this variable correlated with HIV emergence. This correlation was strong for HIV-2: among 6 West African cities that could have received immigrants infected with SIVsmm, the two cities from the Ivory Coast studied (Abidjan and Bouaké) had much higher frequency of uncircumcised men (60–85%) than the others, and epidemic HIV-2 groups emerged initially in this country only. This correlation was less clear for HIV-1 in Central Africa. Sousa "et al." then built computer simulations to test if an 'ill-adapted SIV' (meaning a simian immunodeficiency virus already infecting a human but incapable of transmission beyond the short acute infection period) could spread in colonial cities. The simulations used parameters of sexual transmission obtained from the current HIV literature. They modelled people's 'sexual links', with different levels of sexual partner change among different categories of people (prostitutes, single women with several partners a year, married women, and men), according to data obtained from modern studies of sexual activity in African cities. The simulations let the parameters (city size, proportion of people married, GUD frequency, male circumcision frequency, and transmission parameters) vary, and explored several scenarios. Each scenario was run 1,000 times, to test the probability of SIV generating long chains of sexual transmission. The authors postulated that such long chains of sexual transmission were necessary for the SIV strain to adapt better to humans, becoming an HIV capable of further epidemic emergence. The main result was that genital ulcer frequency was by far the most decisive factor. For the GUD levels prevailing in Léopoldville in the early 20th century, long chains of SIV transmission had a high probability. For the lower GUD levels existing in the same city in the late 1950s (see above), they were much less likely. And without GUD (a situation typical of villages in forested equatorial Africa before colonialism) SIV could not spread at all. City size was not an important factor. The authors propose that these findings explain the temporal patterns of HIV emergence: no HIV emerging in tens of thousands of years of human slaughtering of apes and monkeys, several HIV groups emerging in the nascent, GUD-riddled, colonial cities, and no epidemically successful HIV group emerging in mid-20th century, when GUD was more controlled, and cities were much bigger. Male circumcision had little to moderate effect in their simulations, but, given the geographical correlation found, the authors propose that it could have had an indirect role, either by increasing genital ulcer disease itself (it is known that syphilis, chancroid, and several other GUDs have higher incidences in uncircumcised men), or by permitting further spread of the HIV strain, after the first chains of sexual transmission permitted adaptation to the human organism. One of the main advantages of this theory is stressed by the authors: "It [the theory] also offers a conceptual simplicity because it proposes as causal factors for SIV adaptation to humans and initial spread the very same factors that most promote the continued spread of HIV nowadays: promiscuous [sic] sex, particularly involving sex workers, GUD, and possibly lack of circumcision." Iatrogenic theories propose that medical interventions were responsible for HIV origins. By proposing factors that only appeared in Central and West Africa after the late 19th century, they seek to explain why all HIV groups also started after that. The theories centered on the role of parenteral risks, such as unsterile injections, transfusions, or smallpox vaccinations are accepted as plausible by most scientists of the field. Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories include several iatrogenic theories, such as the polio vaccine hypothesis which argues that the early oral polio vaccines were contaminated with a chimpanzee virus, leading to the Central African outbreak. In most non-human primate species, natural SIV infection does not cause a fatal disease (but see below). Comparison of the gene sequence of SIV with HIV should, therefore, give us information about the factors necessary to cause disease in humans. The factors that determine the virulence of HIV as compared to most SIVs are only now being elucidated. Non-human SIVs contain a "nef" gene that down-regulates CD3, CD4, and MHC class I expression; most non-human SIVs, therefore, do not induce immunodeficiency; the HIV-1 "nef" gene, however, has lost its ability to down-regulate CD3, which results in the immune activation and apoptosis that is characteristic of chronic HIV infection. In addition, a long-term survey of chimpanzees naturally infected with SIVcpz in Gombe, Tanzania found that, contrary to the previous paradigm, chimpanzees with SIVcpz infection do experience an increased mortality, and also suffer from a Human AIDS-like illness. SIV pathogenicity in wild animals could exist in other chimpanzee subspecies and other primate species as well, and stay unrecognized by lack of relevant long term studies. David Carr was an apprentice printer (usually mistakenly referred to as a sailor; Carr had served in the Navy between 1955 and 1957) from Manchester, England who died August 31, 1959, and was for some time mistakenly reported to have died from AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (ADOIs). Following the failure of his immune system, he succumbed to pneumonia. Doctors, baffled by what he had died from, preserved 50 of his tissue samples for inspection. In 1990, the tissues were found to be HIV-positive. However, in 1992, a second test by AIDS researcher David Ho found that the strain of HIV present in the tissues was similar to those found in 1990 rather than an earlier strain (which would have mutated considerably over the course of 30 years). He concluded that the DNA samples provided actually came from a 1990 AIDS patient. Upon retesting David Carr's tissues, he found no sign of the virus. One of the earliest documented HIV-1 infections was discovered in a preserved blood sample taken in 1959 from a man from Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo. However, it is unknown whether this anonymous person ever developed AIDS and died of its complications. A second early documented HIV-1 infection was discovered in a preserved lymph node biopsy sample taken in 1960 from a woman from Léopoldville, Belgian Congo. In May 1969 16-year-old African-American Robert Rayford died at the St. Louis City Hospital from Kaposi's sarcoma. In 1987 researchers at Tulane University School of Medicine detected "a virus closely related or identical to" HIV-1 in his preserved blood and tissues. The doctors who worked on his case at the time suspected he was a prostitute or the victim of sexual abuse, though the patient did not discuss his sexual history with them in detail. In 1975 and 1976, a Norwegian sailor, with the alias name Arvid Noe, his wife, and his seven-year-old daughter died of AIDS. The sailor had first presented symptoms in 1969, eight years after he first spent time in ports along the West African coastline. A gonorrhea infection during his first African voyage shows he was sexually active at this time. Tissue samples from the sailor and his wife were tested in 1988 and found to contain HIV-1 (Group O). From 1972 to 1973, researchers drew blood from 75 children in Uganda to serve as controls for a study of Burkitt's lymphoma. In 1985, retroactive testing of the frozen blood serum indicated that antibodies to a virus related to HIV were present in 50 of the children. HIV-1 strains were once thought to have arrived in New York City from Haiti around 1971. It spread from New York City to San Francisco around 1976. HIV-1 is believed to have arrived in Haiti from central Africa, possibly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo around 1967. The current consensus is that HIV was introduced to Haiti by an unknown individual or individuals who contracted it while working in the Democratic Republic of the Congo circa 1966, or from another person who worked there during that time. A mini-epidemic followed, and circa 1969, yet another unknown individual took HIV from Haiti to the United States. The vast majority of cases of AIDS outside sub-Saharan Africa can be traced back to that single patient (although numerous unrelated incidents of AIDS among Haitian immigrants to the U.S. were recorded in the early 1980s, and as evidenced by the case of Robert Rayford, isolated incidents of this infection may have been occurring as early as 1966). The virus eventually entered male gay communities in large United States cities, where a combination of casual, multi-partner sexual activity (with individuals reportedly averaging over 11 unprotected sexual partners per year) and relatively high transmission rates associated with anal intercourse allowed it to spread explosively enough to finally be noticed. Because of the long incubation period of HIV (up to a decade or longer) before symptoms of AIDS appear, and because of the initially low incidence, HIV was not noticed at first. By the time the first reported cases of AIDS were found in large United States cities, the prevalence of HIV infection in some communities had passed 5%. Worldwide, HIV infection has spread from urban to rural areas, and has appeared in regions such as China and India. A Canadian airline steward named Gaëtan Dugas was referred to as "Case 057" and later "Patient O" with the alphabet letter "O" standing for "outside Southern California", in an early AIDS study by Dr. William Darrow of the Centers for Disease Control. Because of this, many people had considered Dugas to be responsible for taking HIV to North America. However, HIV reached New York City around 1971 while Dugas did not start work at Air Canada until 1974. In Randy Shilts' 1987 book "And the Band Played On" (and the 1993 movie based on it), Dugas is referred to as AIDS' Patient Zero instead of "Patient O", but neither the book nor the movie states that he had been the first to bring the virus to North America. He was incorrectly called "Patient Zero" because at least 40 of the 248 people known to be infected by HIV in 1983 had had sex with him, or with someone who had sexual intercourse with him. A volunteer social worker called Betty Williams, a Quaker who worked with the homeless in New York from the seventies and early eighties onwards, has talked about people at that time whose death would be labelled as "junkie flu" or "the dwindles". In an interview for the Act Up Oral History Project in 2008, she said: "Of course, the horror stories came, mainly concerning women who were injection-drug users ... who had who had PCP pneumonia (Pneumocystis pneumonia), and were told that they just had bronchitis." She continues: "I actually believe that AIDS kind of existed among this group of people first, because if you look back, there was something called junkie pneumonia, there was something called the dwindles that addicts got, and I think this was another early AIDS population way too helpless to ever do anything for themselves on their own behalf." Julia Epstein writes in her book 'Altered Conditions: Disease, Medicine and Storytelling' that: "As we uncover more of the early history of HIV infection, it becomes clear that by at least the 1970s the virus was already making major inroads into the immune systems of a number of diverse populations in the United States (the retrospectively diagnosed epidemic of 'junkie pneumonia' in New York City in the late 1970's for example) and had for some time been causing devastation in several countries in Africa." Anecdotal evidence suggests that so-called junkie pneumonia first began to afflict heroin addicts in New York in 1977. In her book 'EnGendering AIDS : deconstructing sex, text, and epidemic', Tamsin Wilton writes: "People had been sickening and dying of mysterious conditions since the early 1970's, conditions that we can retrospectively diagnose as AIDS related. There was, for example, a phenomenon known as 'junkie pneumonia' which spread among some populations of injecting street drug users in the 1970's, and which is now believed to have been caused by HIV infection." Melinda Cooper writes in her book 'Family Values: Between Neoliberalism and the New Social Conservatism': "It is plausible that these cases [of AIDS] did not come to light in the 1970s for the same reason that "junkie pneumonia" was not recognized as the sign of an emerging infectious disease: The people in question had such precarious access to health care that news of their death was never communicated to public health authorities." An article by Pattrice Maurer in the newspaper Agenda from April 1992 explores some of the issues surrounding junkie pneumonia. It starts: "In the late 1970s while the epidemic known as "disco fever" swept through the U.S., an epidemic known as "junkie pneumonía" raged among injection drug users in New York City." It continues: "Few people were aware that large numbers of injections drug users were inexplicably dying of pneumonía. Those few who did notice these deaths did not feel compelled to investígate the public health puzzle they posed." The author's opinion is that if anyone had bothered to investigate these deaths, they would have found an immune system disorder that is now called AIDS. Steven Thrasher writes in The Guardian: "Indeed, those of us who study AIDS have long known that long before common symptoms such as Kaposi sarcoma and pneumonia were showing up among hemophiliacs and gay men, they were likely affecting homeless people who lived off society’s radar, people who used IV (intravenous) drugs and those who avoided medical treatment out of fear." A chapter in The Proceedings of the World Conference of Therapeutic Communities (9th, San Francisco, California, September 1–6, 1985) gives details about serum samples that were tested for signs of HIV (then called HTLV-III/LAV) antibodies. Quoting: "We have also conducted historical studies of the epidemic in New York City, using serum samples that were originally collected for other purposes. We have sera from IV drug users that go back to the middle 1960's. The first indication of HTLV-III/LAV antibody presence is in one of eleven samples from 1978 ... 29% of 40 samples in 1979 ... 44% of samples from 1980 and 52% of samples from 1982. The HTLV-III/LAV virus appears to have been introduced among IV drug users in the late 1970's in New York City." In an article published in "AIDS: Cultural Analysis/Cultural Activism", author Douglas Crimp draws attention to anecdotal evidence about junkie pneumonia. Quoting: "Even these statistics are based on CDC epidemiology that continues to see the beginning of the epidemic as 1981 ... in spite of widespread anecdotal reporting of a high rate of deaths throughout the 1970s from what was known as "junkie pneumonia" and was likely Pneumocystis pneumonia." The statistics Crimp writes about were taken from a New York Times article from October 1987 about a NYC Department of Health study that showed that 53% of AIDS sufferers were people who injected drugs - more than 150 percent higher than previously reported. Quoting: "City health officials estimated that half of the city's 200,000 intravenous drug users were infected with the virus that causes AIDS". The study "HIV-1 Infection Among Intravenous Drug Users in Manhattan, New York City, from 1977 through 1987", published in February 1989, seeks to understand long term trends in the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users (IDUs). AIDS surveillance data and studies which detail the number of persons who tested HIV positive in Manhattan are used to compile information deemed critical to realising the extent of the AIDS epidemic. It starts by stating that up to September 1988, IDU was the risk behaviour in 19,139 (or 26.4%) of the first 72,223 cases of AIDS in the USA. Cases among IDUs in New York in the same period numbered 6,182 (approximately a third of national IDU cases). The study continues to outline the methodology used in the compilation of data. It says that while truly representative samples of IDUs within a community are probably impossible to obtain, samples of IDUs entering treatment provide a good source for monitoring trends. In the "RESULTS" section it states (quoting): "The first evidence for HIV-1 infection among IV drug users in New York is from three cases of AIDS in children born in 1977. These cases were later reported to the New York City Department of Health AIDS Surveillance Unit. These children did not receive any known transfusions prior to developing AIDS and were born to mothers known to be IV drug users." It continues to outline that the earliest known case of AIDS in an adult IDU occurred in 1979 (mixed risk) and that known cases among IDUs increased rapidly from the 8 cases in 1980 (3 mixed risk), to 31 cases in 1981, to 160 cases in 1982, and to 340 cases in 1983. Statistics on the amount of positive tests for HIV, mainly using archived samples, are: 1978 1 out of 11; 1979 13/50; 1980 8/21; 1981-83 14/28; 1984 75/137 and 38/63; 1986 36/55 and 1987 169 out of 294. In the COMMENTS section, it states: "The three cases in 1977 of apparent perinatal transmission (mother-to-child) from IV drug-using women strongly suggest that the introduction of HIV-1 into the IV drug-use group occurred around 1975 or 1976, or perhaps even earlier." It says that without extensive samples from this period, it is not possible to be certain about the spread of HIV among IDUs, but the samples from IDUs with chronic liver disease suggest that the rates of infection were below 20% for the first 3 or 4 years after its introduction. HIV is thought to have entered the population of people using intravenous drugs in New York in approximately 1975. In Spring 1975, the government of New York underwent a fiscal crisis which led to the closing of many social services, with people who used intravenous drugs living in a hostile sociopolitical and legal environment. This fiscal crisis lead to many agencies with health responsibilities being particularly hard hit, which in turn might have led to an increase in HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (TB). Quoting from a 2006 American Journal of Public Health study: "Between 1974 and 1977, the Department of Health (DOH) budget (in NY) was cut by 20%, and by 1977 the department had lost 1700 staff members—28% of its 1974 workforce. To achieve these reductions, the department closed 7 of 20 district health centers, cut $1 million from its methadone program, terminated the employment of 14 of 19 health educators, and closed 20 of 75 child health stations and 6 of 14 chest clinics (the units responsible for TB screening and diagnosis)." A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association links TB and HIV/AIDS. Quoting: ""Severe and unusual presentation of overwhelming tuberculosis in appropriate clinical circumstances may be considered an infection predictive of the presence of AIDS." Further, a study from 1987 states there was a link between the rise in TB, AIDS and drug users within the United States. Quoting: "AIDS thus compounds the risk of acquiring tuberculosis, and in the United States most patients with AIDS and tuberculosis have been drug users." A newsletter from Spring 1987 by the National Coalition Of Gay STD Services has an article called "Tuberculosis and AIDS - Connecticut" that suggests an association between TB and AIDS within that state. The AIDS epidemic officially began on June 5, 1981, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in its "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report" newsletter reported unusual clusters of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) caused by a form of "Pneumocystis carinii" (now recognized as a distinct species "Pneumocystis jirovecii") in five homosexual men in Los Angeles. Over the next 18 months, more PCP clusters were discovered among otherwise healthy men in cities throughout the country, along with other opportunistic diseases (such as Kaposi's sarcoma and persistent, generalized lymphadenopathy), common in immunosuppressed patients. In June 1982, a report of a group of cases amongst gay men in Southern California suggested that a sexually transmitted infectious agent might be the etiological agent, and the syndrome was initially termed "GRID", or gay-related immune deficiency. Health authorities soon realized that nearly half of the people identified with the syndrome were not homosexual men. The same opportunistic infections were also reported among hemophiliacs, users of intravenous drugs such as heroin, and Haitian immigrants – leading some researchers to call it the "4H" disease. By August 1982, the disease was being referred to by its new CDC-coined name: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). In New York City, Nathan Fain, Larry Kramer, Larry Mass, Paul Popham, Paul Rapoport, and Edmund White officially established the Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC) in 1982. Also in 1982, Michael Callen and Richard Berkowitz published "." In this short work, they described ways gay men could be sexual and affectionate while dramatically reducing the risk of contracting or spreading HIV. Both authors were themselves gay men living with AIDS. This booklet was one of the first times men were advised to use condoms when having sexual relations with other men. In May 1983, a team of doctors at the Pasteur Institute in France including Françoise Barré-Sinoussi and Luc Montagnier reported that they had isolated a new retrovirus from lymphoid ganglions that they believed was the cause of AIDS. The virus was later named lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) and a sample was sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which was later passed to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). In May 1984 a team led by Robert Gallo of the United States confirmed the discovery of the virus, but they renamed it human T lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III). Dr. Jay Levy's group at the University of California, San Francisco also played a role in the discovery of HIV. He independently isolated the AIDS virus in 1983 and named it the AIDS-associated Retrovirus (ARV), publishing his findings in the journal Science in 1984. In January 1985, a number of more-detailed reports were published concerning LAV and HTLV-III, and by March it was clear that the viruses were the same --- indeed, it was later determined that the virus isolated by the Gallo lab was from the lymph nodes of the patient studied in the original 1983 report by Montagnier --- and was the etiological agent of AIDS. In May 1986, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ruled that both names should be dropped and a new name, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), be used. Whether Gallo or Montagnier deserve more credit for the discovery of the virus that causes AIDS has been a matter of considerable controversy. Together with his colleague Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, Montagnier was awarded one half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his "discovery of human immunodeficiency virus". Harald zur Hausen also shared the prize for his discovery that human papilloma virus leads to cervical cancer, but Gallo was left out. Gallo said that it was "a disappointment" that he was not named a co-recipient. Montagnier said he was "surprised" Gallo was not recognized by the Nobel Committee: "It was important to prove that HIV was the cause of AIDS, and Gallo had a very important role in that. I'm very sorry for Robert Gallo." Dr Levy's contribution to the discovery of HIV was also cited in the Nobel Prize ceremony. Since June 5, 1981, many definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the Bangui definition and the 1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition. According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2008, a team led by Robert Shafer at Stanford University School of Medicine has discovered that the gray mouse lemur has an endogenous lentivirus (the genus to which HIV belongs) in its genetic makeup. This suggests that lentiviruses have existed for at least 14 million years, much longer than the currently known existence of HIV. In addition, the time frame falls in the period when Madagascar was still connected to what is now the African continent; the said lemurs later developed immunity to the virus strain and survived an era when the lentivirus was widespread among other mammalia. The study is being hailed as crucial, because it fills the blanks in the origin of the virus, as well as in its evolution, and may be important in the development of new antiviral drugs. In 2010, researchers reported that SIV had infected monkeys in Bioko for at least 32,000 years. Previous to this time, it was thought that SIV infection in monkeys had happened over the past few hundred years. Scientists estimated that it would take a similar amount of time before humans adapted naturally to HIV infection in the way monkeys in Africa have adapted to SIV and not suffer any harm from the infection. A 2016 Czech study of the genome of Malayan flying lemurs, an order of mammals parallel to primates and sharing an immediate common ancestor with them, found endogenous lentiviruses that emerged an estimated 40-60 million years ago based on rates of viral mutation versus modern lentiviruses. Other hypotheses for the origin of AIDS have been proposed. AIDS denialism argues that HIV or AIDS does not exist or that AIDS is not caused by HIV; some of its proponents believe that AIDS is caused by lifestyle, including sexuality or drug use, and not by HIV. Some conspiracy theories allege that HIV was created in a bioweapons laboratory, perhaps as an agent of genocide or an accident. These hypotheses have been rejected by scientific consensus; it is generally accepted among pathologists that "…the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive", and most "scientific" arguments for denialism are based on misrepresentations of outdated data. </doc> <doc id="2340496" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340496" title="TeamBath"> TeamBath TeamBath is the brand name for the family of sports, health and leisure-related activities at the University of Bath.

Alongside Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Vallabh Bhai Patel, Pant was a key figure in the movement for India's Independence and later a pivotal figure in the Indian Government. He was one of the foremost political leaders of Uttar Pradesh (then known as United Provinces) and a key player in the unsuccessful movement to establish Hindi as the national language of Indian Union. Today, as a mark of tribute, several Indian hospitals, educational institutions and foundations bear his name. To honour his exemplary services to the nation, Pant received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1957. Govind Ballabh Pant was born on 10 September 1887 in Khoont village on the slopes of Shyahi Devi hill near Almora, in a Brahmin family having their roots in Maharashtra. His mother's name was Govindi Bai. His father Manorath Pant was a government official who was constantly on the move, and hence Govind was brought up by his maternal grandfather, Badri Dutt Joshi, an important government official locally, who played a significant part in moulding his personality and political views. Pant studied at Allahabad University and subsequently worked as a lawyer in Kashipur. Here, he began active work against the British Raj in 1914, when he helped a local "parishad", or village council, in their successful challenge of "coolie begar", a law requiring locals to provide free transportation of the luggage of travelling British officials. In 1921, he entered politics and was elected to the Legislative Assembly of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Known as an extremely capable lawyer, Pant was appointed by the Congress party to initially represent Ramprasad Bismill, Ashfaqulla Khan and other revolutionaries involved in the Kakori case in the mid 1920s. In 1930, he was arrested and imprisoned for several weeks for organising a Salt March inspired by Gandhi's earlier actions. In 1933, he was arrested along with Harsh Dev Bahuguna (Gandhi of Choukot) and imprisoned for seven months for attending a session of the then-banned provincial Congress. In 1935, the ban was rescinded, and Pant joined the new Legislative Council. During the Second World War, Pant acted as the tiebreaker between Gandhi's faction, which advocated supporting the British Crown in their war effort, and Subhas Chandra Bose's faction, which advocated taking advantage of the situation to expel the British Raj by all means necessary. In 1934, the Congress ended its boycott of the legislatures and put up candidates, and Pant was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly. His political skills won the admiration of the leaders of the Congress, and he became deputy leader of the Congress party in the Assembly. In 1940, Pant was arrested and imprisoned for helping organise the Satyagraha movement. In 1942 he was arrested again, this time for signing the Quit India resolution, and spent three years in Ahmednagar Fort along with other members of the Congress working committee until March 1945, at which point Jawaharlal Nehru pleaded successfully for Pant's release, on grounds of failing health. Pant took over as the Chief Minister of the United Provinces from 1937 to 1939. In 1945, the British Labour government ordered new elections to the Provincial legislatures. The Congress won a majority in the 1946 elections in the United Provinces and Pant was again the Premier, continuing even after India's independence in 1947. His judicious reforms and stable governance in the Uttar Pradesh stabilised the economic condition of the most populous State of India. Among his achievements in that position was the abolition of the zamindari system. Also he passed the Hindu Code Bill and made monogamy compulsory for Hindu men and gave the Hindu women the rights of divorce and inheritance to ancestral property. His rich and judicious experience was sought in India’s political capital. Pant moved from Lucknow to New Delhi to be sworn in as Cabinet Minister without Portfolio in the Union Cabinet on 3 January 1955. Pant served as Union Home Minister from 1955–1961. Pant was appointed Minister of Home Affairs in the Union Cabinet on 10 January 1955 in New Delhi by Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. As Home Minister, his chief achievement was the re-organisation of States along linguistic lines. He was also responsible for the establishment of Hindi as an official language of the central government and a few states. During his tenure as the Home Minister, Pant was awarded the Bharat Ratna. on 26 January 1957 for his selfless service as an Independent activist, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh and Home Minister. In 1960, he suffered a heart attack. He was treated by top doctors in India, including his friend Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy, the then Chief Minister of West Bengal. His health started deteriorating and he died on 7 March 1961 at the age of 74, from a cerebral stroke. At that time he was still in office as the Home Minister of India. Mourning him, Dr Rajendra Prasad, the then President of India was quoted as saying,“I had known Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant since 1922 and in this long period of association it had been my privilege to receive from him not only consideration but also affection. This is no time to assess his labour and his achievements. The grief is too intense for words. I can only pray for peace to his soul and strength to those who loved and admired him”. Govind Ballabh Pant's son, Krishna Chandra Pant, was also a politician. </doc> <doc id="2340514" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340514" title="Zarubintsy culture"> Zarubintsy culture The Zarubintsy or Zarubinets culture was a culture that from the 3rd century BC until 1st century AD flourished in the area north of the Black Sea along the upper and middle Dnieper and Pripyat Rivers, stretching west towards the Southern Bug river. Zarubintsy sites were particularly dense between the Rivers Desna and Ros as well as along the Pripyat river. It was identified around 1899 by the Czech-Ukrainian archaeologist Vikentiy Khvoyka and is now attested by about 500 sites. The culture was named after finds cremated remains in the village of Zarubintsy, on the Dnieper. The Zarubintsy culture is connected to the early Slavs ("proto-Slavs"), with possible links to the peoples of the Vistula basin. The culture was influenced by the La Tène culture and the nomads of the steppes (the Scythians and the Sarmatians). The Scythian and Sarmatian influence is evident, especially in pottery, weaponry and domestic and personal objects. The bearers of the culture engaged in agriculture, documented by numerous finds of sickles. Pobol suggested that the culture experienced a transition from swidden ('slash-and-burn') to plough-type cultivation. In addition, they raised animals. Remains included sheep, goat, cattle, horses and swine. There is evidence they also traded wild animal skins with Black Sea towns. Some sites were defended by ditches and banks, structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe. Dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types, with posts supporting the walls, a hearth in the middle, and large conic pits located nearby. Inhabitants practiced cremation. Cremated remains were either placed in large, hand-made ceramic urns, or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and Middle to Late La-Tene type "fibulae". The disintegration of the Zarubintsy culture has been linked with the emigration of its population in several directions. Density of settlements in the central region decrease, as late Zarubintsy groups appear radially, especially southward into the forest-steppe regions of the middle Dnieper, Desna and southern Donets rivers. Influences upon local cultures in the east Carpathian/ Podolia region, as well as, to a lesser extent, north into the forest zone are also evident. The movement of Zarubintsy groups has been linked to an increasingly arid climate, whereby the population left the hillforts on high promontories and moved southward into river valleys. This mostly southern movement brought them closer to westward moving Sarmatian groups (from the Don region) and Thracian-Celtic elements. By the 3rd century AD, central late Zarubintsy sites 're-arranged' into the so-called Kiev culture, whilst the westernmost areas were integrated into the Wielbark culture. </doc> <doc id="2340516" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340516" title="Cave Hill Cemetery"> Cave Hill Cemetery Cave Hill Cemetery is a Victorian era National Cemetery and arboretum located at 701 Baxter Avenue, Louisville, Kentucky, United States. Its main entrance is on Baxter Avenue and there is a secondary one on Grinstead Drive. It is the largest cemetery by area and number of burials in Louisville. Cave Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Cave Hill National Cemetery, containing military graves, is also on the National Register, added in 1998. Cave Hill was chartered in 1848 on what was William Johnston's Cave Hill Farm, then a rural property some distance east of Louisville. Johnston, who died in 1798, had built the first brick house in Louisville on the grounds circa 1788. City officials had purchased part of the land in the 1830s in anticipation of building a railroad through it, and a workhouse was built there. The railroad was built elsewhere, and the land was leased to local farmers. In 1846, Mayor Frederick A. Kaye began investigating the possibility of developing a garden-style cemetery on the grounds, a popular concept at the time. Hartford, Connecticut civil engineer Edmund Francis Lee was hired, who planned a cemetery with winding paths, graves across the tops of hills, and lakes and ponds in the valleys. The Cave Hill Cemetery Co. was chartered in February 1848, and the cemetery was dedicated on July 25, 1848. Reverend Doctor Edward Porter Humphrey delivered the dedicatory address and elaborated on the idea of the garden cemetery, noting, among other things, that ". . .Reason and taste suggest that [this cemetery] should be decorated appropriately by the beautiful productions of our great Creator. . ." Before the era of large municipal parks, it was common for cities to promote a garden cemetery as a green oasis and recreation destination, and Louisville was no exception. This largely ended with the opening of nearby Cherokee Park in 1892. After administrators sold several acres of land for the burial of Union soldiers during the Civil War, local Confederate supporters purchased nearby land as well. Several deceased patients from the Brown General Hospital and other nearby army medical facilities were interred in Cave Hill Cemetery. Johnston's farmhouse (in what is now sections 33 and 34) was converted to the city's pesthouse, and was demolished in 1872. Also in 1872, Beechhurst Sanitarium was built near the pesthouse and the modern Grinstead entrance. Beechurst was torn down in 1936. The grounds were expanded and remapped in 1888 to their modern size of nearly . In the 1980s, razor wire was added to the brick walls surrounding Cave Hill to keep out after-hours visitors. The first scenic overlook for the cemetery, Twin Lakes Scenic Overlook, opened on August 20, 2008. The signature Baxter Avenue entrance, called the Broadway Entrance by the cemetery, was completed in 1892. The Corinthian-style building includes a bell in its clock tower. The tower, once the tallest structure for miles, was frequently hit by lightning and last renovated in 2001. The Grinstead Drive entrance was built in 1913. The third public entrance on the residential street of Dearing Court was closed as of 2007. Another public entrance, also no longer in use, was built off Payne Street in 1910, closest to the military sections. There are several service entrances around the perimeter. Other buildings include the stone office building near the lake, and the Rustic Shelter House built in 1892 at a cost of $565. The cemetery contains monuments and graves of three Union generals. The 32nd Indiana Monument, also known as the "August Bloedner Monument", is separately on the National Register. The middle fork of Beargrass Creek runs through Cave Hill, and a source stream flowing into the creek roughly divides the cemetery in new (eastern) and old (western) sections. That stream flows from a spring near the cave that gave the property its name. The cave can be entered for about , and then there is a marginal amount of crawl space beyond that, however the cave is officially off limits. There are also five man-made lakes. The cemetery currently features more than 500 species of trees and shrubs, including some two dozen current state champion trees, including both native species such as pignut hickory ("Carya glabra") and exotics such as Caucasian wingnut ("Pterocarya fraxinifolia"). It is well known as an arboretum. There were about 120,000 people interred by 2002, with space remaining for 22,000 more graves. Notable among those interred in the cemetery is American Revolutionary War military war officer and founder of Louisville George Rogers Clark (1752-1818). More than 200 Confederate soldiers are buried in Section "O" of the cemetery, with 30–40 buried in a row near the National Cemetery. The original wooden markers in Section "O" were replaced with stone markers in 1880–1881. A number of markers are marked as unknown. Included in the Section "O" burials is a Confederate Brigadier General, Alpheus Baker. There are two other Confederate generals buried in other locations in the cemetery. In the addition to Section "O" (lot 267½) are a number of residents of the Kentucky Confederate Home, who died around the start of the 20th century. The confederate flag flies over the area. Within another U.S. Soldiers plot in Section E is one British war grave, of a soldier of the Machine Gun Corps, a member of the British Military Mission to the United States, who died in 1918. Muhammad Ali, boxing champion born in Louisville, was interred on June 10, 2016. Also interred is the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Colonel Harland Sanders. </doc> <doc id="2340523" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340523" title="Sana'a International School"> Sana'a International School 017 Sanaa International School is an international school on the edge of the city of Sanaa, Yemen, serving ages 2–18. Currently, the school's operations are suspended . It is a nonprofit organization founded in 1971. It provides an English language education, primarily to the children of embassy and United Nations personnel and international workers such as oil and gas businesses. It also educates many Yemeni students planning to enter western universities. The school teaches pre-school – Grade 12 levels. As of 2013 it has a total enrollment of some 73 students from over 11 nationalities. The school has had to deal with the political crisis in Yemen, with an average of 16 students leaving since 2011. Sanaa International School is the only accredited school in the whole of Yemen and has been accredited by the US-based Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools since 1983. Sanaa International School is part of Quality Schools International James E. Gilson, who previously served as the principal of Yemen-American Cooperative School in Taiz, then in Yemen Arab Republic a.k.a. North Yemen, opened the Sanaa International School in Sanaa, North Yemen in September 1971. Gilson, who had lost his job after the Taiz school closed in 1967, had accepted a teaching position in Saudi Arabia early that year and hired a couple as the Sanaa International School's first teachers. The school's initial enrollment was four students. Gilson and his family moved to Sanaa in July 1972 as the Sanaa school enrollment increased to 25. That year the school began efforts to establish a permanent campus, and three years of discussions and meetings began. Several persons within the United Nations and the government of Germany, the United States, and North Yemen made efforts to get the school permanent land. Meanwhile, within several years the enrollment was at over 200. An advisory board, including foreigners and Yemenis, established the school's articles of association and by laws in 1974, forming the nonprofit organization and resulting in the school having a board of directors. On December 22, 1976, the school began occupying a plot of land given by the North Yemen government given for free for a 50-year period. On January 1 the school's permanent facilities began construction, and on May 7 of that year the school signed a formal agreement, including the land grant, with the North Yemen government. The school is located on a plot of land. This campus includes academic buildings, a workshop, a playground, a residential house, and two water wells which were constructed in the 1970s. In 1992 a domed auditorium and athletic facility, which was carpeted, opened. The spacious, purpose built facility incorporates traditional Yemeni architectural features, and is surrounded by farmland and mountains. The library and media center are in the heart of the school, and provide access directly to and from the main classrooms. This facility is supplemented by language classrooms, an arts room, a state of the art computer lab, gymnasium and performance room. The exterior sports facilities provide opportunities for soccer, softball, tennis, basketball, track and field, orienteering, climbing, and archery. The school has an annual drama performance. The school makes is sporting facilities available to local schools by hosting various sporting events throughout the year. Bus transport is provided to students and teachers. In addition to an academic program the school runs a varied selection of field trips and excursions. These include yearly visits to Bab-el-Mandeb to observe the migration of raptors from Siberia to Africa, camping expeditions to the island of Socotra, international trips of both cultural and sporting natures, and many local trips. Staff retention is well above average for an international school, with SIS teachers having an average tenure of more than 7 years. SIS graduates are routinely accepted at top universities in North America, Europe, and the Middle East. In recent years one in three graduates heading to the USA have been offered scholarships in Ivy League universities. </doc> <doc id="2340542" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340542" title="Angellica Bell"> Angellica Bell Angellica Bell is a British television and radio presenter, best known for her roles on "The One Show" and for winning the 2017 series of "Celebrity MasterChef".

As of 2016, approximately 36.7 million people are living with HIV globally. In 2016, approximately half are men and half are women. There were about 1.0 million deaths from AIDS in 2016, down from 1.9 million in 2005. The 2015 Global Burden of Disease Study, in a report published in "The Lancet", estimated that the global incidence of HIV infection peaked in 1997 at 3.3 million per year. Global incidence fell rapidly from 1997 to 2005, to about 2.6 million per year, but remained stable from 2005 to 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected. In 2010, an estimated 68% (22.9 million) of all HIV cases and 66% of all deaths (1.2 million) occurred in this region. This means that about 5% of the adult population in this area is infected. Here, in contrast to other regions, women compose nearly 60% of cases. South Africa has the largest population of people with HIV of any country in the world, at 7.06;million. as of 2017. In Tanzania, HIV/AIDS was reported to have a prevalence of 4.5% among Tanzanian adults aged 15–49 in 2017 . South & South-East Asia (a region with about 2 billion people as of 2010, over 30% of the global population) has an estimated 4 million cases (12% of all people living with HIV), with about 250,000 deaths in 2010. Approximately 2.5 million of these cases are in India, where however the prevalence is only about 0.3% (somewhat higher than that found in Western and Central Europe or Canada). Prevalence is lowest in East Asia at 0.1%. In 2008, approximately 1.2 million people in the United States had HIV; 20% did not realize that they were infected. Over the 10-year period from 1999 to 2008, it resulted in about 17,500 deaths per year. In the United Kingdom, as of 2016, there were approximately 89,400 cases and 428 deaths. In Australia, as of 2017, there were about 27,545 cases. In Canada as of 2016, there were about 63,110 cases. A reconstruction of its genetic history shows that the HIV pandemic almost certainly originated in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, around 1920. AIDS was first recognized in 1981 and by 2009 had caused nearly 30 million deaths. HIV in World in 2014 – data from CIA World Factbook By December 16, more than 19.5 million people were receiving antiretroviral therapy. HIV/AIDS in World from 2001 to 2014 – adult prevalence rate – data from CIA World Factbook The pandemic is not homogeneous within regions, with some countries more afflicted than others. Even at the country level, there are wide variations in infection levels between different areas. The number of people infected with HIV continues to rise in most parts of the world, despite the implementation of prevention strategies, Sub-Saharan Africa being by far the worst-affected region, with an estimated 22.9 million at the end of 2010, 68% of the global total. South and South East Asia have an estimated 12% of the global total. The rate of new infections has fallen slightly since 2005 after a more rapid decline between 1997 and 2005. Annual AIDS deaths have been continually declining since 2005 as antiretroviral therapy has become more widely available. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the hardest-hit region. HIV infection is becoming endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, which is home to just over 12% of the world’s population but two-thirds of all people infected with HIV. The adult HIV prevalence rate is 5.0% and between 21.6 million and 24.1 million total are affected. However, the actual prevalence varies between regions. Presently, Southern Africa is the hardest hit region, with adult prevalence rates exceeding 20% in most countries in the region, and 30% in Swaziland and Botswana. Eastern Africa also experiences relatively high levels of prevalence with estimates above 10% in some countries, although there are signs that the pandemic is declining in this region. West Africa on the other hand has been much less affected by the pandemic. Several countries reportedly have prevalence rates around 2 to 3%, and no country has rates above 10%. In Nigeria and Côte d'Ivoire, two of the region's most populous countries, between 5 and 7% of adults are reported to carry the virus. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, more women are infected with HIV than men, with 13 women infected for every 10 infected men. This gender gap continues to grow. Throughout the region, women are being infected with HIV at earlier ages than men. The differences in infection levels between women and men are most pronounced among young people (aged 15–24 years). In this age group, there are 36 women infected with HIV for every 10 men. The widespread prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases, the promiscuous culture, the practice of scarification, unsafe blood transfusions, and the poor state of hygiene and nutrition in some areas may all be facilitating factors in the transmission of HIV-1 (Bentwich et al., 1995). Mother-to-child transmission is another contributing factor in the transmission of HIV-1 in developing nations. Due to a lack of testing, a shortage in antenatal therapies and through the feeding of contaminated breast milk, 590,000 infants born in developing countries are infected with HIV-1 per year. In 2000, the World Health Organization estimated that 25% of the units of blood transfused in Africa were not tested for HIV, and that 10% of HIV infections in Africa were transmitted via blood. Poor economic conditions (leading to the use of dirty needles in healthcare clinics) and lack of sex education contribute to high rates of infection. In some African countries, 25% or more of the working adult population is HIV-positive. Poor economic conditions caused by slow onset-emergencies, such as drought, or rapid onset natural disasters and conflict can result in young women and girls being forced into using sex as a survival strategy. Worse still, research indicates that as emergencies, such as drought, take their toll and the number of potential 'clients' decreases, women are forced by clients to accept greater risks, such as not using contraceptives. AIDS-denialist policies have impeded the creation of effective programs for distribution of antiretroviral drugs. Denialist policies by former South African President Thabo Mbeki's administration led to several hundred thousand unnecessary deaths. UNAIDS estimates that in 2005 there were 5.5 million people in South Africa infected with HIV — 12.4% of the population. This was an increase of 200,000 people since 2003. Although HIV infection rates are much lower in Nigeria than in other African countries, the size of Nigeria's population meant that by the end of 2003, there were an estimated 3.6 million people infected. On the other hand, Uganda, Zambia, Senegal, and most recently Botswana have begun intervention and educational measures to slow the spread of HIV, and Uganda has succeeded in actually reducing its HIV infection rate. HIV/AIDS prevalence in the Middle East and North Africa is around 0.2% (0.1–0.7%), with between 230,000 and 1.4 million people infected. Among young people 15–24 years of age, 0.3% of women [0.1–0.8%] and 0.17% of men [0.1–0.3%] were living with HIV infection by the end of 2004. Approximately 500,000 people are living with HIV in the MENA region. This number is estimated at 470,000 (350,000–570,000) without Afghanistan and Pakistan (which are not considered by UNAIDS geographic definition as part of MENA region), and reaches 580,000 (430,000–810,000) if Pakistan and Afghanistan are included. In 2015, only 37% of people living with HIV were actually aware of their status. Despite the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the MENA region, there are epidemics among vulnerable groups with an evidence of substantial proportion of local spread within the region. As of 2012, the prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men in Egypt is estimated to be 5.0%–9.9%. The HIV prevalence rate in South and South-East Asia is less than 0.35 percent, with total of 4.2 – 4.7 million adults and children infected. More AIDS deaths (480,000) occur in this region than in any other except sub-Saharan Africa. The geographical size and human diversity of South and South-East Asia have resulted in HIV epidemics differing across the region. In South and Southeast Asia, the HIV epidemic remains largely concentrated in injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, sex workers, and clients of sex workers and their immediate sexual partners. In the Philippines, in particular, sexual contact between males comprise the majority of new infections. An HIV surveillance study conducted by Dr. Louie Mar Gangcuangco and colleagues from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital showed that out of 406 MSM tested for HIV in Metro Manila, HIV prevalence was 11.8% (95% confidence interval: 8.7- 15.0). Migrants, in particular, are vulnerable and 67% of those infected in Bangladesh and 41% in Nepal are migrants returning from India. This is in part due to human trafficking and exploitation, but also because even those migrants who willingly go to India in search of work are often afraid to access state health services due to concerns over their immigration status. The national HIV prevalence levels in East Asia is 0.1% in the adult (15–49) group. However, due to the large populations of many East Asian nations, this low national HIV prevalence still means that large numbers of people are infected with HIV. The picture in this region is dominated by China. Much of the current spread of HIV in China is through injecting drug use and paid sex. In China, the number was estimated at between 430,000 and 1.5 million by independent researchers, with some estimates going much higher. In the rural areas of China, where large numbers of farmers, especially in Henan province, participated in unclean blood transfusions; estimates of those infected are in the tens of thousands. In Japan, just over half of HIV/AIDS cases are officially recorded as occurring amongst homosexual men, with the remainder occurring amongst heterosexuals and also via drug abuse, in the womb or unknown means. In East Asia, men who have sex with men account for 18% of new HIV/AIDS cases and are therefore a key affected group along with sex workers and their clients who makeup 29% of new cases. This is also a noteworthy aspect because men who have sex with men had a prevalence of at least 5% or higher in countries in Asia and Pacific. The Caribbean is the second-most affected region in the world. Among adults aged 15–44, AIDS has become the leading cause of death. The region's adult prevalence rate is 0.9%. with national rates ranging up to 2.7%. HIV transmission occurs largely through heterosexual intercourse. A greater number of people who get infected with HIV/AIDS are heterosexuals. with two-thirds of AIDS cases in this region attributed to this route. Sex between men is also a significant route of transmission, even though it is heavily stigmatised and illegal in many areas. HIV transmission through injecting drug use remains rare, except in Bermuda and Puerto Rico. Within the Caribbean, the country with the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS is the Bahamas with a rate of 3.2% of adults with the disease. However, when comparing rates from 2004 to 2013, the number of newly diagnosed cases of HIV decreased by 4% over those years. Increased education and treatment drugs will help to decrease incidence levels even more. The populations of Central and South America have approximately 1.6 million people currently living with HIV and this number has remained relatively unvarying with having a prevalence of approximately .4%. In Latin America, those living with the disease have received help in the form of Antiretroviral treatment, with 75% of people with HIV receiving the treatment. In these regions of the American continent, only Guatemala and Honduras have national HIV prevalence of over 1%. In these countries, HIV-infected men outnumber HIV-infected women by roughly 3:1. With HIV/AIDS incidence levels rising in Central America, education is the most important step in controlling the spread of this disease. In Central America, many people do not have access to treatment drugs. This results in 8–14% of people dying from AIDS in Honduras. To reduce the incidence levels of HIV/AIDS, education and drug access needs to improve. In a study of immigrants traveling to Europe, all asymptomatic persons were tested for a variety of infectious diseases. The prevalence of HIV among the 383 immigrants from Latin America was low, with only one person testing positive for a HIV infection. This data was collected from a group of immigrants with the majority from Bolivia, Ecuador and Colombia. Since the epidemic began in the early 1980s, 1,216,917 people have been diagnosed with AIDS in the US, with 1.1 million people in 2014 living with HIV. 1 in 7 of them are not aware of it, with an estimated 161,200 (13%) not having been diagnosed. In 2015, 39,513 people were diagnosed with HIV infection in the United States, a decrease of 19% from 2005 to 2014. The decrease may be due to targeted HIV prevention efforts, but progress has been uneven, and diagnoses have increased among a few groups. Men who had sex with men accounted for approximately 8 out of 10 HIV diagnoses among males. Diagnoses dropped 18% overall among white homosexual and bisexual men, but rose 24% among Hispanic/Latino and 22% among African American homosexual and bisexual men (87% among those aged 13 to 24), respectively. HIV diagnoses declined 35% among all heterosexuals (heterosexual contact accounting for 24% of HIV diagnoses), and 63% among people who inject drugs. Diagnoses also declined 40% among all women, and 42% among African American women. Regionally, the population rates (per 100,000 people) of persons diagnosed with HIV infection in 2015 were highest in the South (16.8), followed by the Northeast (11.6), the West (9.8), and the Midwest (7.6). The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV continues to be through male homosexual sexual relations. In general, recent studies have shown that 1 in 5 gay and bisexual men were infected with HIV. As of 2014, in the United States, 83% of new HIV diagnoses among all males aged 13 and older and 67% of the total estimated new diagnoses were among homosexual and bisexual men. Those aged 13 to 24 also accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group. A review of studies containing data regarding the prevalence of HIV in transgender women found that nearly 11.8% self-reported that they were infected with HIV. Along with these findings, recent studies have also shown that transgender women are 34 times more likely to have HIV than other women. A 2008 review of HIV studies among transgender women found that 28 percent tested positive for HIV. In the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, 20.23% of black respondents reported being HIV-positive, with an additional 10% reporting that they were unaware of their status. AIDS is one of the top three causes of death for African American men aged 25–54 and for African American women aged 35–44 years in the United States of America. In the United States, African Americans make up about 48% of the total HIV-positive population and make up more than half of new HIV cases, despite making up only 12% of the population. The main route of transmission for women is through unprotected heterosexual sex. African American women are 19 times more likely to contract HIV than other women. By 2008, there was increased awareness that young African-American women in particular were at high risk for HIV infection. In 2010, African Americans made up 10% of the population but about half of the HIV/AIDS cases nationwide. This disparity is attributed in part to a lack of information about AIDS and a perception that they are not vulnerable, as well as to limited access to health-care resources and a higher likelihood of sexual contact with at-risk male sexual partners. Since 1985, the incidence of HIV infection among women had been steadily increasing. In 2005 it was estimated that at least 27% of new HIV infections were in women. There has been increasing concern for the concurrency of violence surrounding women infected with HIV. In 2012, a meta-analysis showed that the rates of psychological trauma, including Intimate Partner Violence and PTSD in HIV positive women were more than five times and twice the national averages, respectively. In 2013, the White House commissioned an Interagency Federal Working Group to address the intersection of violence and women infected with HIV. There are also geographic disparities in AIDS prevalence in the United States, where it is most common in the large cities of California, esp. Los Angeles and San Francisco and the East Coast, ex. New York City and in urban cities of the Deep South. Rates are lower in Utah, Texas, and Northern Florida. Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, has the nation's highest rate of infection, at 3%. This rate is comparable to what is seen in west Africa, and is considered a severe epidemic. In the United States in particular, a new wave of infection is being blamed on the use of methamphetamine, known as crystal meth. Research presented at the 12th Annual Retrovirus Conference in Boston in February 2005 concluded that using crystal meth or cocaine is the biggest single risk factor for becoming HIV+ among US gay men, contributing 29% of the overall risk of becoming positive and 28% of the overall risk of being the receptive partner in anal sex. In addition, several renowned clinical psychologists now cite methamphetamine as the biggest problem facing gay men today, including Michael Majeski, who believes meth is the catalyst for at least 80% of seroconversions currently occurring across the United States, and Tony Zimbardi, who calls methamphetamine the number one cause of HIV transmission, and says that high rates of new HIV infection are not being found among non-crystal users. In addition, various HIV and STD clinics across the United States report anecdotal evidence that 75% of new HIV seroconversions they deal with are methamphetamine-related; indeed, in Los Angeles, methamphetamine is regarded as the main cause of HIV seroconversion among gay men in their late thirties. The chemical "methamphetamine", in and of itself, cannot infect someone with HIV. In Canada, nearly 60,000 people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005. The HIV-positive population continues to increase in Canada, with the greatest increases amongst aboriginal Canadians. As in Western Europe, the death rate from AIDS in North America fell sharply with the introduction of combination AIDS therapies (HAART). There is growing concern about a rapidly growing epidemic in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where an estimated 1.23–3.7 million people were infected as of December 2011, though the adult (15–49) prevalence rate is low (1.1%). The rate of HIV infections began to grow rapidly from the mid-1990s, due to social and economic collapse, increased levels of intravenous drug use and increased numbers of prostitutes. By 2010 the number of reported cases in Russia was over 450,000 according to the World Health Organization, up from 15,000 in 1995 and 190,000 in 2002; some estimates claim the real number is up to eight times higher, well over 2 million. There are predictions that the infection rate in Russia will continue to rise quickly, since education there about AIDS is almost non-existent. Ukraine and Estonia also have growing numbers of infected people, with estimates of 650,000 and 4,400 respectively in 2011. The disease is now officially epidemic in this region, which means that prevention strategies may not be able to halt and reverse its spread. Also, transmission of HIV is increasing through sexual contact and drug use among the young (<30 years). Indeed, over 84% of current AIDS cases in this region occur in non-drug-using heterosexuals less than 26 years of age. In most countries of Western Europe, AIDS cases have fallen to levels not seen since the original outbreak; many attribute this trend to aggressive educational campaigns, screening of blood transfusions and increased use of condoms. Also, the death rate from AIDS in Western Europe has fallen sharply, as new AIDS therapies have proven to be an effective (though expensive) means of suppressing HIV. In this area, the routes of transmission of HIV is diverse, including paid sex, injecting drug use, mother to child, male with male sex and heterosexual sex. However, many new infections in this region occur through contact with HIV-infected individuals from other regions. The adult (15–49) prevalence in this region is 0.3% with between 570,000 and 890,000 people currently infected with HIV. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS deaths have stayed low since the lows of the late 1990s. However, in some countries, a large share of HIV infections remain undiagnosed and there is worrying evidence of antiretroviral drug resistance among some newly HIV-infected individuals in this region. There is a very large range of national situations regarding AIDS and HIV in this region. This is due in part to the large distances between the islands of Oceania. The wide range of development in the region also plays an important role. The prevalence is estimated at between 0.2% and 0.7%, with between 45,000 and 120,000 adults and children currently infected with HIV. Papua New Guinea has one of the most serious AIDS epidemics in the region. According to UNAIDS, HIV cases in the country have been increasing at a rate of 30 percent annually since 1997, and the country's HIV prevalence rate in late 2006 was 1.3%. In June 2001, the United Nations held a Special General Assembly to intensify international action to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic as a global health issue, and to mobilize the resources needed towards this aim, labelling the situation a "global crisis". Regarding the social effects of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, some sociologists suggest that AIDS has caused a "profound re-medicalisation of sexuality". Social factors also influence HIV/AIDS. A 2003 study states that HIV and AIDS are less prevalent in Muslim populations and speculates that this may be due to the effect of several Islamic tenets, such as avoidance of alcohol leading to less risky sexual behavior and benefits arising from circumcision. </doc> <doc id="2340559" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340559" title="Tighe"> Tighe Tighe may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2340561" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340561" title="Glynis Breakwell"> Glynis Breakwell Dame Glynis Marie Breakwell, DBE, DL, FRSA, FAcSS (born West Bromwich, 26 July 1952) is the former Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bath in Bath. She is a social psychologist and an active public policy adviser and researcher specialising in leadership, identity process and risk management. In January 2014 she was listed in the Science Council's list of '100 leading UK practising scientists'. Breakwell has been a Fellow of the British Psychological Society since 1987 and an Honorary Fellow since 2006. She is a chartered health psychologist and in 2002 was elected an Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences. Breakwell was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to higher education. She is also a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Somerset. In 2016, former education minister Andrew Adonis called for an inquiry in the House of Lords as he criticised the “serious controversy” of salary increases awarded to Breakwell as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bath. A pay rise of 11%, well above the 1.1% cap on pay for non-managerial staff across the higher education sector, took her yearly earnings to £451,000. “Put all that together, and Glynis Breakwell is paid almost exactly half a million pounds, more than three times the prime minister’s salary” said Lord Adonis. It was also reported around the same time by a freedom of information request submitted by Bath councillor Joe Rayment that Breakwell claimed an extra £20,000 in domestic expenses despite living in a grace-and-favour property owned by the university. In protest against Breakwell's pay package, four MPs resigned from the university court (advisory board) for the University of Bath: Darren Jones, Kerry McCarthy, David Drew, and Andrew Murrison. Critics speculated that the controversy surrounding Breakwell's salary has led to a decline in applications; the university suffered an 18.5% drop in applications from non-EU applicants for 2018 entry, and an overall 6% drop against an 11.5% jump in applications for Bath's six closest competitors. A freedom of information request by the Bath Chronicle revealed Breakwell secured a further 3.9% pay rise in the 2016-17 academic year, raising her total wages and benefits to more than £468,000. This led Adonis to refer to her pay rise – awarded whilst she herself was a member of the remuneration committee – as a "disgrace" and to call for her to resign. In response Breakwell issued a statement saying “The university is committed to the highest standards of governance and treats very seriously any complaint made.” Addressing the issue of her salary in a 2015 interview, Breakwell stated: “I’m worth it...I’ve been in the job a long time and you do tend to get increases over time in most jobs. Frankly, I don’t think that there is anything I could say that would stop people saying that I earn too much and vice-chancellors earn too much, so I cannot engage in a conversation because I don’t think there is a way through.” On 28 November 2017 Breakwell announced that she would step down as vice-chancellor on 31 August 2018, at the end of the 2017-18 academic year, and take a fully paid sabbatical semester before formally retiring on 28 February 2019. As part of the terms of her resignation, the university will write off the interest-free loan for her £31,000 car which she can keep. Andrew Adonis called the terms of her resignation "outrageous" and that she was the worst case of "fat-cat pay", saying the sabbatical meant that she would be paid £700,000 to go. A joint statement from trade unions representing staff at the University of Bath urged for Breakwell's resignation to be effective immediately, citing concerns over Breakwell continuing to exercise authority which generated a "climate of fear" on campus. On the 16th January 2018, the university court voted in favour for the immediate dismissal of Breakwell. </doc> <doc id="2340562" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340562" title="Christopher Tugendhat, Baron Tugendhat"> Christopher Tugendhat, Baron Tugendhat Christopher Samuel Tugendhat, Baron Tugendhat (born 23 February 1937 in Marylebone) is a British Conservative Party politician, business man, company director, journalist, and author. He was a Member of Parliament from 1970–77, then a member of the European Commission, and in 1993 was appointed as a life peer, with a seat in the House of Lords, in which he remains active. Tugendhat's family background includes Austrian-Jewish ancestry on his father's side and Anglo-Irish on his mother's. He was brought up as a Roman Catholic. His father, Dr Georg Tugendhat (1898-1973), was born in Vienna, but came to Britain after the First World War to pursue a doctorate at the London School of Economics, and while there married Marie Littledale in 1934. Georg Tugendhat traced his paternal origins to the town of Bielitz in Silesia, which until 1918 was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but became part of Poland in 1920. Tugendhat was educated at King's College School, Cambridge, Ampleforth College and Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, then took up a career in journalism, becoming a features editor and leader writer for the "Financial Times" from 1960-70. In 1970 he was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for the Cities of London and Westminster, remaining in the House of Commons until 1977, when he resigned after being appointed as a member of the European Commission. He was first appointed to the commission by a Labour government over the head of the nominee of the Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, but four years later, as prime minister, Thatcher reappointed him, and he served as vice-president of the Commission from 1981 until 1985. On 3 December 1980, when he was driving away from his home in Brussels, two bullets were fired at Tugendhat from a car, narrowly missing him; he called the attack "closer than I would have liked." The Provisional IRA claimed responsibility for the assassination attempt. Following his role at the European Commission, Tugendhat was chairman of the Royal Institute for International Affairs (Chatham House) from 1986 to 1995, and of the Civil Aviation Authority from 1986 to 1991, when he was succeeded by Christopher Chataway. In 1993 he was appointed to the House of Lords as a life peer on the nomination of John Major. He later went on to become the chairman of Abbey National, Blue Circle Industries, the European Advisory Board of Lehman Brothers, and the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust. He was also a director of Rio Tinto and Eurotunnel, among other companies. Tugendhat is a member of the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) Advisory Board, an independent financial think tank which serves as a neutral, non-lobbying platform for exchanges among official institutions and private sector counter-parties worldwide. He married Julia Lissant Dobson; they have two sons, James (born 1971) and Angus (born 1974). His younger brother, Michael, is a judge of the High Court of England and Wales, and his nephew Tom Tugendhat has been the Conservative Member of Parliament for Tonbridge and Malling since May 2015. Tugendhat was knighted in the 1990 Birthday Honours. On 15 October 1993 he was created a life peer as Baron Tugendhat of Widdington in the County of Essex. In 1998 he became the Chancellor of the University of Bath, from which position he stood down in 2013, to be succeeded by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex. He was chairman of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, the UK's first academic health science centre, until December 2011. In 1998 he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by the University of Bath. </doc> <doc id="2340565" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340565" title="Sex Is Not the Enemy"> Sex Is Not the Enemy "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was a single released from Garbage's fourth album "Bleed Like Me" in June 2005 in United Kingdom. It was released as joint-second single from the album—around the same time the song "Bleed Like Me" was released in the U.S. and there was a parallel release for "Run Baby Run" in Australia and Europe. "Sex Is Not the Enemy" followed later that summer in Australia. Following on from the top ten chart position for predecessing single "Why Do You Love Me", and despite the band promoting the single with headline show at London's Brixton Academy, "Sex Is Not the Enemy" failed to replicate that success in the UK, peaking in the top thirty, becoming their last Top 40 hit in there. "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was first written in 2003 at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. On August 15, singer Shirley Manson wrote on her online journal that it sounded "like old school Garbage". "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was influenced by the February 1, 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, which led to a censorship row in the media after singer Janet Jackson's bare breast was exposed by Justin Timberlake in what was referred to as a "wardrobe malfunction". Manson noticed that the incident was featured on the "USA Today" cover for three days in a row with no mention of the Iraq War. Manson felt the media "was only focusing on Janet's beautiful tit, which I thought was bizarre". The singer declared that there are "a lot worse things to have your children see on TV that parents are happily plopping their kids down in front of", and thus she wrote a song "sort of dealing with that and dealing with the idea that this administration is really clamping down on reproductive rights and stuff like that. So it's sort of heavy, but it's coated in this really anthemic, upbeat party song." Over time, Manson would work on the lyrics to the song, writing in her view that the Bush administration had clamped down on gay rights, reproductive rights and people's civil liberties. Later, she recalled "'Sex Is Not the Enemy' is sort of a manifesto in a way. I had no idea it was until I looked back and thought, 'This really is an anthem to my sexual politics'". Guitarist Steve Marker added: "At first it wasn't supposed to be anything other than a party song." Musically, "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was mutated a number of times during writing; after some changes the band went back to the song's original verse melody, Manson writing on her journal there was "at least three different versions of this song". On May 25, Garbage confirmed a list of 14 songs being worked on for the record, including "Sex Is Not the Enemy", and on December 14 confirmed that the song would be included on the finished album "Bleed Like Me". On March 28, 2005, Garbage performed the track on Canal+ "Album de la semaine" before debuting the song live on stage at the Paris Olympia the following day. "Sex Is Not The Enemy" would later appear as a regular item in the band's Strange Little Birds and Rage and Rapture Tour during 2016–17, with the latter tour normally seeing the song performed second after "No Horses". On April 10, "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was confirmed by Garbage drummer Butch Vig confirmed to fans in Los Angeles that the track would be the second UK single taken from "Bleed Like Me". In the weeks prior to release, XFM was the only major radio station to playlist "Sex Is Not the Enemy"—neither Radio One or Radio 2 did. Garbage did not perform any television promo for the single bar a few interviews on "TRL", "Popworld", "" and "hit40uk". On June 9, Garbage headlined a sold-out concert at Brixton Academy and a day later performed at the Download Festival in advance of the single; on June 19, they returned to the UK to perform the single along with "Why Do You Love Me" at T4's televised "Party on the Beach" show. On June 13 "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was released in the United Kingdom on CD, DVD and limited edition 7" vinyl. At the start of that week, the 7" was issued in white vinyl in a regular picture sleeve, but by the end of the week, stores were stocking copies with a limited red taped cover. "Sex Is Not the Enemy" debuted on the UK singles chart at #24; the next week falling to #66 before leaving the chart. The single performed only slightly better on the Scottish chart, reaching #22. Warners serviced a few remixes of the tracks to clubs and on July 3 a digital download bundle of the single and B-side "Honeybee" was made available from iTunes but these did not improve sales of the single. By August 29, new unofficial 12" vinyls were in circulation featuring remixes of the song by Freaks (Justin Harris & Luke Solomon) and by DJ Hell/Fischerspooner side-project Naughty. Despite rumours of a U.S. release for "Sex Is Not the Enemy", and a July 4 video premiere on Music Choice, no single was released. In September 2005, "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was released to Australian radio up-front of the band's September 21 Australian tour Canberra debut show; and on September 11 FMR released a "Bleed Like Me" special edition with a bonus DVD, which included the "Sex Is Not The Enemy" promo video and "making of" documentary. "Sex Is Not the Enemy" ended up being the final single release from "Bleed Like Me" in both Australia and the United Kingdom. When Garbage disbanded on a self-imposed hiatus following the completion of the Australian tour and the UK release of "Sex Is Not the Enemy", follow-up "Run Baby Run" was cancelled. On May 22, 2007 it was officially confirmed that "Sex Is Not The Enemy" would not be included on the band's greatest hits album "Absolute Garbage", most likely due to the song's commercial failure in the UK. "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was backed with B-sides "Honeybee" and "Never Be Free". Both tracks were recorded during the sessions for "Bleed Like Me". An acetate of "Never Be Free" leaked from Chrysalis Music Group in 2003, but the track did not end up on the internet. While Vig describes "Honeybee" as "Neil Young-esque, with a druggy feel", Manson wrote the song was "pretty dark and twisted. It's a lusty, yearning moan." "Honeybee" featured drums performed by Matt Walker, while "Never Be Free" credited John5 with guitar. Both tracks were written and produced by Garbage, although "Never Be Free" may have originally been a John Lowery co-write. Producer James Michael may have also worked on the track at one point. The video for "Sex Is Not the Enemy" was filmed on April 20 and April 21 and was a low-budget video shot by Sophie Muller. On the first day of shooting, both Manson and Muller shot scenes in a hotel room and at Times Square in New York City. On the second day the band filmed live footage at their show at Washington D.C.'s . The video featured a stunt where Shirley was arrested on-stage after exposing her breasts (actually a flesh-coloured bra) and was dragged off the stage by hired actors posing as policemen, visually referencing and almost parodying the song's take on the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. The audience were not let in on the stunt; and afterwards boo-d and heckled at the venue, many of the audience thinking it had been a Punk'd stunt. The band was filmed rehearsing for the stunt, and footage was included on a mini-documentary on the "Sex Is Not the Enemy" DVD. Butch Vig recalled: "We shot a lot of footage of Shirley running around New York. She was getting up on a soapbox with a bullhorn and just yelling at people. And it was funny, 'cause people thought, 'Oh, another crazy woman.' They just ignored her." The video first aired in the United Kingdom the week of May 16, after a full day of exclusive streaming from Garbage's website and premiered in the U.S. on July 4. In 2006, the "Sex Is Not the Enemy" video became available to download on digital stores worldwide.

It is noted for its controversial artwork as well as its hit singles "Party Hard" and "She Is Beautiful". "I Get Wet" was recorded while Andrew W.K. was living in New York City. The first songs written for the album were "It's Time to Party" and "Take It Off." The album was recorded with many layers of overdubbing, in order to make the album "sound as party as we could make it sound," and for the "sound of the songs to be like one instrument" instead of a collection of individual musicians. One inspiration for the album was Andrew W.K's enjoyment of intense, major-key music, something he attributed to his musical childhood experiences with the piano. Another inspiration for "I Get Wet" was the charity single "We Are the World" by USA for Africa. Andrew W.K. was impressed with how all the artists on the song were singing all at once, something he described as a "powerful sound, like an orchestra." In turn, Andrew W.K. wanted to create music that sounded like that. "I Get Wet" is known for its highly recognizable cover art shot by famed art photographer Roe Ethridge: a photo of a wet-haired Andrew W.K. with a large stream of blood running from his nose, down his chin and onto his throat. This cover art caused a controversy in Europe, as it was seen to represent cocaine abuse and violence. To achieve the effect, W.K. initially said that he struck himself in the face with a brick during the photo shoot, but later explained that it did not lead to enough blood flow. Consequently, he supplemented his own blood with some of an animal which he got from a butcher's shop. The album went to #1 on "Billboard"'s Top Heatseekers chart. The songs "Party Hard" and "She Is Beautiful" were released as singles. The opening track, "It's Time to Party", was featured in an advertisement for Hotwire.com, a Coors spot and an Expedia ad. "Fun Night" can be heard in the 2003 film "Old School". The track, "Don't Stop Living in the Red" was featured in an ad for Target. "I Love NYC" is frequently played at New York Rangers games. "Ready to Die" is used in the "Hitman" game series, as well as the trailer for the upcoming game "Rage 2". On August 28, 2012, a deluxe reissue of "I Get Wet" was released. The reissue contained previously unheard recordings, demos, live tracks, and alternate mixes. A limited number of autographed deluxe editions contained a lock of Andrew's hair, a piece of his white jeans, or an autographed plane ticket from his 2012 world tour. "I Get Wet" provoked sharp critical reaction when it was initially released, with "Pitchfork"s Ian Cohen retrospectively writing that "critics of Andrew W.K. were often branded as the fun police and his fans considered fools or incurable ironists." On the review aggregate site Metacritic, the album holds a score of 64 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thompson of "The A.V. Club" described "I Get Wet" as "more fabulously entertaining the louder it's played" and added that "if it wipes out a generation of hard-rock crybabies along the way, fans will owe him a debt of gratitude that can never be repaid." Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" also gave the album a positive review, stating that "there's no denying the over-the-top whomp of his music, the loudest and funniest metal you've heard in ages." David Browne, writing in "Entertainment Weekly", noted that W.K. "must know how ridiculous this all sounds, but he attacks the material with such fervor that you almost believe he means every word." AllMusic's Heather Phares noted that while the album "has a certain sameness due to the frenetic beat that drives nearly every track, it's the perfect complement to W.K.'s party-centric vision", praising it as "refreshingly simple and cleverly stupid." Adrien Begrand of "PopMatters" gave the album a mixed review, writing "At its best, WK’s music is a refreshing blast of skanky air on the current stale music scene, but at its worst, it’s disappointingly monotonous, unoriginal, and very, very dumb." Evan Chakroff of "Stylus Magazine" called it a "worthless piece of rock-product, 35 minutes of glossy, overproduced tripe", but concluded that "once these songs have pounded their way into your head, you can’t help but pay attention" and "if this is a joke, it's a brilliant one." Ryan Schreiber of "Pitchfork" panned the album as being "about as empty as rock music gets, right down to the tinny, digitally processed tonebank noise that passes for 'guitars.'" "Q" listed "I Get Wet" as one of the best 50 albums of 2001. "NME" included "I Get Wet" in their retrospective list of the best albums of 2001. Rhapsody ranked the album at number two on its "Rock's Best Albums of the Decade" list. Despite initially panning the album, "Pitchfork" placed "I Get Wet" at number 144 on their list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. Ian Cohen of "Pitchfork" named the 2012 reissue "Best New Reissue", acknowledging it as the website's "biggest statistical mea culpa ever", writing that "whether you consider these songs to be brilliant, brilliantly dumb, or just dumb, "I Get Wet" is necessarily simple". Andrew W.K. reflected on the album's initial reaction in a 2012 interview, saying: All songs composed by Andrew W.K. Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.

The song was released in Europe and Australia as the album's fourth and final single. It was released around the same time the United Kingdom received a parallel release for "Sex Is Not The Enemy" and "Bleed Like Me" was released in the United States. Following on from the unexpectedly high chart positions for both the previous single "Why Do You Love Me" and the parent album "Bleed Like Me", "Run Baby Run" failed to replicate their success. "Run Baby Run" was to be the third single release from "Bleed Like Me" in the United Kingdom, scheduled to be released at the same time as the band's UK tour. After the tour was cancelled, Garbage went on a self-imposed hiatus and the single release was postponed and quietly cancelled. A US single release was also considered. "Run Baby Run" was first written by the end of 2003 at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. The song began from an idea by guitarist Duke Erikson, and took a lot of work to complete. The band, while happy with the chorus, rebuilt the rest of the song around it; most of the song's original verses, lyrics and melody were re-written. Garbage didn't finish the song until the very end of the album sessions. Shirley Manson later recalled, "'Run Baby Run' is about trying to engineer your own peace of mind and being unafraid to make changes in your life in order to try and facilitate that. [It's] about escape and engineering your own path in life. We're all too guilty of thinking that peace, love and healthiness are things that we're all just given". The singer added that fairy tales gave "this idea that somebody's gonna come along and fix your life", but eventually "I sort of came to the realization that actually nobody's gonna fix your life for you, you have to do it yourself. And it's about just making an effort to make your life good. If it sucks, do something about it." Erikson added, "Being expected to go through life to behave a certain way; I think 'Run Baby Run' is a plea to run from that. Run with your life, take it wherever it takes you. It's about not conforming." On May 25, 2004, Garbage confirmed a list of 14 songs being worked on for the record, including "Run", and on December 14, confirmed that the song, now under the final title of "Run Baby Run", would be included on the finished album "Bleed Like Me". On April 10, 2005, Garbage drummer Butch Vig told fans in Los Angeles that "Run Baby Run" would be the second European single taken from "Bleed Like Me"; and on April 17, Garbage debuted "Run Baby Run" live at Boston Avalon. On May 15, "Run Baby Run" was sent to European radio, and on May 20 it was officially confirmed for physical single release. The "Run Baby Run" video was first shown online at the band's website on June 10, before being sent for airplay on June 15. The initial European release date was June 20. The week "Run Baby Run" was provided to Australian radio, it was the number-two most added track; and on 10 July was released on CD maxi. Despite the top 20 success of previous single "Why Do You Love Me", the single debuted at number 49. Garbage were completing European dates; including a show broadcast Europe-wide from Trieste ("Isle of MTV"), during which "Run Baby Run" was performed prior to the rescheduled 1 August release of the single across Europe. Despite both a maxi and single CD format being planned; only the maxi was ever issued. On August 15, "Run Baby Run" reached number 97 on the German Singles Chart. By June 30, "Run Baby Run" had received a number of adds to UK radio and TV; and a tentative September 12 issue date. "Run Baby Run" was rescheduled for release in the UK on October 24; however the single was cancelled after the band's UK tour was pulled. The "Run Baby Run" video was pulled from television; despite adds to music channels. A March 20, 2006 release date for a reworked version of "Run Baby Run", upfront of a listed "Absolute Garbage" issue date was rumored, but did not happen. On May 22, 2007, it was officially confirmed that "Run Baby Run" would not be included on "Absolute Garbage". "Run Baby Run" was generally very well received by contemporary pop music critics, a number of whom, including "NME", commented on the track as part of "Bleed Like Me"'s strong opening half. "Rolling Stone" felt the song recreated the 80s new wave sound better than efforts from bands like Kasabian and Bloc Party: "Surrounded by a black forest of power-chord distortion, Manson pleads and prays like Deborah Harry atop a bouncing, throaty guitar riff that New Order would envy." The "New York Daily News" also picked up on the New Order sound, commenting that the band had given the bass guitar "the best hook". Peter Murphy, of "Hot Press", described "Run Baby Run" as one of the band's most positive songs; "[It] glows with compassion, forgiveness and self-acceptance." "Rolling Stone" felt that song's "tender, dreamy verses" brought to mind "Just Like Heaven" by The Cure. On the weekend of May 31, 2005, Manson and Muller filmed the video for "Run Baby Run" in London, Paris, Berlin and Istanbul. By June 8, the video was ready to air, and on June 12, it premiered on Garbage's official website. Locations filmed in include within Charles de Gaulle International Airport and on the Paris Métro crossing over the Seine on the Viaduc d'Austerlitz (France); outside the Olympiastadion and in Mohrenstraße and Neu-Westend stations on the Berlin U-Bahn (Germany); and around and within Istanbul's Hotel Pera Palas, Haydarpaşa Terminal and over the Bosphorus strait (Turkey). Studio shots were filmed in London. "Run Baby Run" was backed with B-sides "Honeybee" and "Never Be Free" which had been previously been released on the UK "Sex Is Not The Enemy" single. Both tracks were recorded during the sessions for "Bleed Like Me". An acetate of "Never Be Free" leaked from Chrysalis Music Group in 2003, but the track did not end up on the internet. The single also contained a demo version of "Badass" (once titled "Teach Me Tonight"), that had been left unfinished from album sessions in October 2003. Exclusive to the "Run Baby Run" release, "Badass" leaked onto the Internet on June 13, 2005, a month before the single was issued. While Vig describes "Honeybee" as "Neil Young-esque, with a druggy feel", Manson wrote the song was "pretty dark and twisted. It's a lusty, yearning moan". "Honeybee" featured drums performed by Matt Walker, while "Never Be Free" credited John5 with guitar. All three tracks were written and produced by Garbage, although "Never Be Free" may have originally been a John Lowery co-write. Producer James Michael may have also worked on the track at one point. </doc> <doc id="2340590" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340590" title="Castle Pinckney"> Castle Pinckney Castle Pinckney was a small masonry fortification constructed by the United States government by 1810, in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. It was used very briefly as a prisoner-of-war camp (six weeks) and artillery position during the American Civil War. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Located on Shutes Folly, a small island about one mile off the Charleston shore in the harbor, the fort was built over the ruins of an older fortification called "Fort Pinckney". The original log and earthen fort, named after the Revolutionary War hero Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, was built beginning in 1797 and was intended to protect the city from a possible naval attack when war with France seemed imminent. Completed in 1804, it saw no hostilities and was virtually destroyed by a severe hurricane in September of that year. A replacement brick-and-mortar structure called "Castle Pinckney" was erected in 1809–1810 and was garrisoned throughout the War of 1812, but it saw no action during the two-and-a-half-year conflict. Afterwards, Castle Pinckney was abandoned and fell into disrepair. Two decades later, a sea wall was completed and the fort was re-garrisoned during the Nullification Crisis of 1832, when President Andrew Jackson prepared to collect a controversial tariff using military force if necessary. After that brief period of activity, the fort again fell into disuse and was primarily a storehouse for gunpowder and other military supplies. By the late 1850s, Castle Pinckney was part of a network of defensive positions in the harbor, which included the larger and more strategically placed Forts Sumter and Moultrie, and other, smaller earthworks and fortifications. In 1860, Castle Pinckney's armament consisted of fourteen 24-pounders, four 42-pounders, four 8-inch howitzers, one 10-inch and one 8-inch mortar, and four light field pieces to protect its flanks. On December 27, 1860, one week after South Carolina seceded from the Union, the fort was surrendered to South Carolina (S.C.) militia by its small U.S. Army garrison, which retired to Fort Sumter to join Major Robert Anderson. Castle Pinckney became the first Federal military installation seized forcefully by a Southern state government. Three days later, the Union's Charleston Arsenal joined Castle Pinckney in falling to S.C. forces. After the subsequent Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the Charleston Zouave Cadets garrisoned Castle Pinckney. One hundred and fifty-four Union Army prisoners of war (120 enlisted, 34 officers) captured during the First Battle of Manassas and previously incarcerated at Ligon's Prison arrived at Charleston on September 10, 1861, and were kept at the Charleston City Jail until the lower casemates of Castle Pinckney were converted into cells. According to the "Charleston Mercury", Richmond officials had selected "chiefly from among those who have evidenced the most insolent and insubordinate disposition." On September 18, prisoners from the 11th NY Fire Zouaves, 69th NY ("Irish") Regiment, 79th NY Regiment, and 8th Michigan Infantry were transferred to Castle Pinckney. They were allowed to wander during the day and were confined to cells only at night. The Castle quickly proved to be too small and inadequate, however, for permanent confinement; the prisoners were transferred back to the Charleston City Jail on October 31, 1861, after only six weeks. After the prisoners were removed, the fort was strengthened with earthen embankments and with additional mortars and Columbiads on the barbette tier. On December 12, the prisoners were transferred back to the island, following a fire which had burned a large section of Charleston and damaged the jail. They remained for just over a week with many sleeping on the inner parade ground before being transferred. After the Civil War, the fort was modernized for possible use during the Spanish–American War, but again it was not needed. Some sources suggest that the fort never fired a single hostile shot during its existence. Parts of the old brick walls and casements were dismantled in 1890, to make way for a harbor lighthouse, which operated into the 20th century. There was local opposition to the plans for the lighthouse; a movement had been undertaken to construct a retirement home for servicemen on the island instead. Castle Pinckney was declared a U.S. National Monument in 1924 by Presidential proclamation. In 1951, Congress passed a bill to abolish Castle Pinckney National Monument and transferred it back to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The island became excess property subject to sale by the Federal government in March 1956. The island was acquired by the State Ports Commission [now called the S.C. Ports Authority] as a spoil area in 1958 for $12,000, but the Commission investigated improving part of the land and using it as a historic destination. Plans for the use of the island as a spoil area proved impractical, and no successful plans for the use of the island as a tourist destination were created by the Commission. The Commission attempted to return the island to the Federal government, but the government declined, citing the cost of operations as outweighing the historical value of the island. The Commission received offers to buy the island for uses including a private residence, a nightclub, and a restaurant; but the agency refused all of them. A fire on December 22, 1967, destroyed an abandoned house on the island, but a warehouse was saved. A local Sons of Confederate Veterans fraternal post took over management and care of the island in the late 1960s, attempting to preserve it and establish a museum. Castle Pinckney was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Eventually, unable to raise the needed funds, the S.C.V. allowed the fort to revert to state ownership. Castle Pinckney has undergone some limited restoration efforts. With its location on an isolated shoal in the middle of the harbor, access is difficult; maintenance is nearly impossible. It is gradually being reclaimed by nature. In June 2011, Castle Pinckney was sold to the Fort Sumter Camp No. 1269, Sons of Confederate Veterans, for $10 Confederate. </doc> <doc id="2340607" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340607" title="The Doomspell Trilogy"> The Doomspell Trilogy The Doomspell Trilogy is a trilogy of fantasy novels by Cliff McNish. The books in this trilogy (in reading order) are: In "The Doomspell", Rachel and, Eric are sucked into a freezing world called Itrea, by a witch called Dragwena. They meet a nice old man named Morpeth, who is over 500 years old and, like Rachel and Eric, was removed from Earth to someone by Dragwena. Rachel is fooled into believing that she is becoming a witch by Dragwena, and her Magic, trying to be helpful, tries to make her a witch. During the transformation, Dragwena lets Rachel inside her mind, giving Rachel access to the spells there. As Rachel's skills develop, she finds that she is more than a match for Dragwena. With the help of the Wizard Larpskendya, she kills Dragwena, and Larpskendya removes the spells making it snow. Morpeth then returns to Earth with Rachel and Eric. In "The Scent of Magic", Dragwena's spirit arrives on the Witches' home world, Ool, and from it Dragwena's mother, Heebra, learns of the children Rachel and Eric. Rachel can do powerful spells and Eric can destroy spells, so Heebra sets out to destroy them and enslave all the other children on Earth. After the witches arrive, they use the children to tease and frustrate Rachel and Eric, who were previously unaware of the presence of other magical children on their home world. Calen, Dragwena's younger sister and Heebra's daughter, trains up another human girl, Heiki, to fight Rachel. Rachel meets a human baby boy named Yemi who is also very powerful. In "The Wizard's Promise", the previously released Gridda Witches have taken over Ool. They try to find Rachel and Eric, and use them to find the Wizards. Larpskendya's brother Serpantha unsuccessfully tries to negotiate with the Griddas, and is imprisoned and tortured to tell the Griddas where the Wizards' home world is. The spectrums, children with large ears, devoted to the protection of the children, try to work out the best strategy to save all the children. In the end, the Griddas (with the help of Eric) find the Wizards' home world, and are welcomed on to it by the original, peaceful witches. The main characters in this trilogy are: Rachel is a very magically gifted child who takes it upon herself to protect the world. After being abducted by the witch Dragwena, she learns how to cast magic. Later, after returning to earth, she serves an important role in novels protecting earth from witch assaults. She decides in "The Wizard's Promise" to go to Ool, instead of letting the Griddas invade their planet. Eric is extremely gifted in that he is the only living person who can destroy spells. Once he has destroyed a spell, the caster of that spell has lost it for ever, and can never cast that spell again. Eric can also sense magic from far away. The griddas find out about this power and uses him to find Orin Fen (the wizards homeworld). He can also take away the magic from magical beings even if they are not using it. Morpeth is a man who was taken from Earth to someone by Dragwena at an early age (as is everyone on someone except for Dragwena). He is described as a small man (under five foot) with a flat square nose. While practicing her spells, Rachel transforms into a particle of dust and enters Morpeth's body to change him, making him taller, rejuvenating his features and giving him back the bright blue eyes and sandy hair he had as a youth. At the end of "The Doomspell", he is returned to his child-form, as are the rest of the people of someone. When the inhabitants of someone are given the choice to return to Earth, or stay on the newly reformed someone, only Morpeth chooses to return. Morpeth chooses to give up his magic, but, finding he needs it for his comfort, later asks Larpskendya to return it. Dragwena is a High Witch, the daughter of Heebra. Dragwena tried to instill Magic in the children of the Earth, so that they could be used in the Witches' war against the Wizards. However, she was banished from Earth by the Wizards, who imprisoned her on Ithrea (a very lenient punishment, as she had a whole world to herself, though she was isolated from her sister Witches). She found a way to circumvent the Wizards' ban, and snatched the most magical children from the Earth. When she was defeated, her soul made a journey back to the Witches' home world, where it told Heebra and Calen of Earth, Rachel, and Eric, prompting the Witches to come to Earth to learn more about the magical children. She has four sets of teeth and a snake wrapped round her neck. Larpskendya is a Wizard, one of the two last wizards alive (Larpskendya's brother, Serpantha is the other one). He helps Rachel and Eric return to Earth in "The Doomspell". He is involved in the war against the Witches, as he is extraordinarily powerful. He was also one of the three of wizards who enslaved the witch Dragwena when she first tried to take over earth. Heebra is the leader of the High Witches. She is an immensely powerful witch, who has been personally involved in the war between the Wizards and the Witches. She is the mother of Dragwena and Calen. She made the decision to release the Griddas to act as a diversion to the Wizards while the Witches were attacking Earth. Calen is the daughter of Heebra and the sister of Dragwena. When the witches invade Earth, she tries to train the children to become merciless and ruthless. She personally trains Heiki to defeat Rachel. Heiki is a girl trained by Calen to defeat Rachel. When she was defeated, Calen left her. At that point Heiki stopped wanting to be a witch and united with Rachel, and first shows her loyalty at the end of "The Scent of Magic" when she stands with Rachel against the witches on Earth. In "The Wizard's Promise", Heiki helps take command of the Earth's defences when Rachel has left for Ool. She was abandoned as a baby and wanted revenge on adults and hated other people too, for reason's left to the reader's imagination, making her the perfect person to fight Rachel as she could easily be convinced she was needed. Yemi is an immensely powerful young child, with power beyond other magic users (for instance, he manages to hold his own against a combined assault by hundreds of Griddas in the third book). He has the ability to take aggressively cast spells and modify the spells of others. He can also "borrow" magic from other people, using it to enhance his own. He is constantly followed by animals, and by his pet butterflies, which are all Camberwell beauties. Serpantha is Larpskendya's brother, and also a Wizard. When Eric communicates with his spells, he finds that they are tired and weary of the battle with the Witches. He willingly goes to negotiate with the Griddas, who imprison and torture him. Eventually he is rescued by Rachel. Gultrathaca is the pack leader of the Griddas, a warlike subspecies of the High Witches. Driven by her lust for violence, she manipulates Eric into finding the location of the Wizard home world Orin Fen so she can make war on the Wizards openly. She also tries to kill Rachel by taking advantage of her trusting nature. </doc> <doc id="2340641" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340641" title="William Maxwell Wood"> William Maxwell Wood William Maxwell Wood (May 27, 1809 – March 1, 1880) was an officer and surgeon in the United States Navy in the middle 19th century. He became the First Surgeon General of the U.S. Navy in 1871, with the equivalent rank of Commodore. He rose to President of the Examining Board in 1868 and Chief of the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in 1870 following his service in the American Civil War as Fleet Surgeon of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron aboard the USS Minnesota and Medical Officer of the James River Flotilla, participating in several famous Naval battles, and establishing temporary hospitals as needed during the Civil War. As BUMED Chief, Wood was instrumental in increasing the stature of the naval surgeon, championing a bill eventually passed by Congress increasing the rank and compensation of physicians in the Navy, enabling the Navy to attract and recruit more qualified physicians. (The Appropriations Bill of 3 March 1871 created the titles of "Surgeon General of the Navy" and "Medical Director" and "established" a formal corps of Medical Officers. Ever since, the Navy Medical Corps has celebrated this day as its anniversary.) During Wood's tenure at the top of BUMED the Naval Hospital at Mare Island, California was completed and opened. Earlier in his career Wood was the personal consulting physician of President Zachary Taylor. Wood is most remembered in U.S. Naval history for his daring journey through Mexico in 1846 at the onset of the Mexican–American War, where he eluded detection and capture as a U.S. spy in enemy territory and successfully provided vital intelligence leading to the possession of California by the Pacific Squadron, as well as providing intelligence information to the Secretary of the Navy in Washington regarding Mexican fortifications and military operations. Wood was an accomplished writer, and authored three books chronicling his voyages and missions with the Pacific and East India Squadrons, and his ideas and recommendations on reforming the U.S. Navy, as well as many literary articles for notable publications of his day. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Wood graduated from the Medical School at the University of Maryland, was appointed Assistant Surgeon on May 16, 1829, and, between 1830 and 1834, served with the West Indies and Home Squadrons, as well as with the Army during the Seminole Wars. For several years he conducted a medical practice in Terre Haute, Indiana, where he and his family followed his mother and siblings in relocating from Baltimore after the completion of the National Road in 1834. He resumed sea duty as Passed Assistant Surgeon aboard the ship-of-the-line in 1836, sailing to St. Petersburg, Russia, where Czar Nicholas boarded and inspected, before the "Independence" sailed to the South Atlantic. Tragically, his wife Hannah died while he was serving on the "Independence" and he returned to Terre Haute to tend to his young daughters Hannah and Elizabeth and the family property in the middle of 1838. During 1839 he served with the West Indies Squadron and the receiving ship in Baltimore, before being assigned to the Pacific Squadron in 1843. He became Fleet Surgeon with the Pacific Squadron in 1844 and, upon completion of his tour in 1846, was about to return to the United States when relations between that country and Mexico became decidedly strained. The commander of the Navy's Pacific Squadron, Commodore John D. Sloat, consequently entrusted certain dispatches to Wood to carry back to the United States with him. Wood volunteered to travel through Mexico and report upon conditions there. Accompanied by the American consul from Mazatlán, Mexico, the former fleet surgeon commenced his journey across Mexico. Arriving at Guadalajara on May 10, Wood and his companion found the town "in a high state of agitation" owing to the reception there of the news of the battles between American and Mexican forces at Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, on the Rio Grande. The surgeon immediately wrote a dispatch to Sloat at Mazatlán, and it was delivered in five days — an exceptional occurrence in those days. His message that hostilities with Mexico had actually commenced was the first tidings of that nature that Sloat had received. Wood meanwhile continued on his journey across Mexico and subsequently arrived at Mexico City to be "startled and shocked by hearing newsboys crying through the streets 'Grand victory over the North Americans.'" He later learned through a trusted friend of the Mexican minister of war that General Zachary Taylor's men had, in fact, annihilated the Mexican Army's choice regiment. Surgeon Wood remained in Mexico City not less than a week and gathered more information which he sent off to Commodore Sloat, apprising him of the situation, via Guadalajara. Wood continued his mission, as he had since the beginning of it, in civilian clothes—running the risk of being apprehended as a spy—and, while posing as an Englishman, inspected the defenses of the castle at Chapultepec. Continuing on to Veracruz, the surgeon carefully took notes on Mexico, its condition and resources. Ultimately, the physician reached a neutral man-of-war and was taken to the flagship of the American blockading squadron. Sailing on a vessel especially detached for the purpose, Wood carried the vital intelligence information to Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, Commodore Sloat took action. As he later recorded in a letter to Wood, "The information you furnished me at Mazatlan from the City of Mexico, via Guadalajara, (at the risk of your life) was the only reliable information I received of that event, and which induced me to proceed immediately to California, and upon my own responsibility to take possession of that country, which I did on 7 July 1846." Sloat considered the performance of Wood's journey through Mexico "as an extraordinary feat, requiring great courage, presence of mind, and address. How you escaped from the heart of an enemy's country ... has always been a wonder to me." Following the Mexican–American War, Wood served in the receiving ship at Baltimore and later went to the steamer , the first US Navy iron-hulled warship, operating on the Great Lakes, and homeported in Erie, Pennsylvania. During this period, he sold his property in Terre Haute, and married a niece of President Zachary Taylor, Rose Mary Carson, daughter of Pennsylvania Senate leader Thomas Carson, and made his home with his family in Erie Pennsylvania until the end of the Civil War. Dr. Wood and Rose had 6 sons and a daughter, including William Maxwell Jr, Charles Erskine Scott, Thomas Carson, Peter Bryson, James McIntosh, David Abbott, and Roberta Morgan. While in Erie, Wood treated President Zachary Taylor during a visit to Erie, and became Taylor's personal consulting physician. From 1853–1855 Wood served at the Naval Hospital at Sackett's Harbor, New York. He again served as Fleet Surgeon—this time with the East India Squadron—from 1856 to 1858, serving under Commodore James Armstrong aboard the , and took part in the negotiations with the King of Siam in opening that country to American trade, in establishing the first American consulate to Japan, and in Commander Andrew H. Foote's attack upon the Chinese Barrier Forts—of "enormous strength ... built of large blocks of granite ... heavily armed."—at Canton, China, in response to Chinese attacks upon American shipping during the Second Opium War. Wood subsequently served a second tour in "Michigan" before he became Fleet Surgeon for the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron aboard the , and the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron during the American Civil War. While serving aboard the flagship , Wood participated in the Battle of Hampton Roads, and witnessed the historic battle of the ironclads USS "Monitor" and CSS "Virginia" (the former ) in Hampton Roads; and later took part in the assault and capture of Sewall's Point, and the capture of the Hatterras Forts. Wood established a Naval Hospital at Sewell's Point, and later served as medical inspector of the James River Flotilla, before being transferred back to the "Michigan" before the end of the U.S. Civil War. After the Civil War, Dr. Wood purchased a farm in Owings Mills, Maryland, named Rosewood Glen, where he and his family would live during the pinnacle of his Naval career, and through retirement until his death in 1880. After his last duty on the USS "Michigan" in Erie, Wood served on various Naval medical examining boards in Boston and New York and at Baltimore and Annapolis in 1866 and 1867 and was President of the Naval Examining Board in 1868. He became Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery in 1870. During his tenure in that role, the Naval Hospital at Mare Island, California was completed and opened. He was appointed the first Surgeon General of the United States Navy and Medical Director on March 3, 1871, with equivalent rank of Commodore, concurrent with Congressional Passage of The Appropriations Bill of 3 March 1871, which created the Navy Medical Corps of Officers. Wood was retired for age later in 1871 but continued to serve the Navy in a civilian capacity as Medical Inspector - General Hospitals and Fleets until his final retirement in 1873. Dr. Wood was a writer of books and essays, focusing on his travels, life at sea in the US Navy, various Naval battles and Naval missions, and his political beliefs and ideas for improving the US Navy. His books include "Wandering Sketches of People and Things in South America, Polynesia, California, and Other Places Visited During a Cruise Aboard the U.S. Ships Levant, Portsmouth, and Savannah", "A Shoulder to the Wheel of Progress", and "Fankwei: or The San Jacinto in the Seas of India, China, and Japan". After retirement Wood managed his farm, Rosewood Glen, in Owings Mills MD with his wife Rose and his children, Peter Bryson, Thomas Carson, James McIntosh, David Abbott, and Roberta Morgan. He became President of the Garrison Woods Farmers Association, and was a member of St. Thomas Episcopal Church. His son William Maxwell Jr attended the US Naval Academy and had a successful career as a Naval Officer. His son Charles Erskine Scott (CES) attended the US Military Academy at West Point whereupon graduation he was assigned to the Northwest US. He is noted for being General Howard's adjutant during the Nez Perce War and transcribed Nez Perce Chief Joseph's surrender speech, eventually becoming a close friend of Chief Joseph, ultimately leaving the military life for a successful legal career in Portland OR, before becoming a noted author and civil libertarian in Portland, Oregon and Los Gatos, California. Wood died at his farm, Rosewood Glen, in Owings Mills, Maryland, March 1, 1880. He is buried at the family plot in the St. Thomas Church Cemetery, along with his wife Rose Carson Wood, a daughter Hannah, and his son Peter Bryson. His grave marker includes the inscription "He served his country well" Dr. Wood was commended by Commodore Sloat, Secretary Bankcroft, and Senator Mallory, Chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs in the Senate of the United States for his successful mission behind enemy lines in Mexico in 1846 and his communication to Commodore Sloat which enabled the US Navy to acquire California at the onset of the War with Mexico. He was posthumously honored in 1901 by The Society of California Pioneers, with his inclusion in the volume "Portraits of Members of the Society of California Pioneers". Wood's name is inscribed in one of the base stones of The Sloat Monument erected at the Presidio in Monterey, California in commemoration of the US Navy's Pacific Fleet taking possession of California in 1846. Four U.S. Navy ships, have been named for Wood; but only two of them were completed and commissioned. The first named for him was the , built in California and commissioned at Mare Island. She was in commission from 1919 to 1930. During World War II, two ships were named "William M. Wood" in his honor but were cancelled before they were built. The first, the , was cancelled in March 1944, as was the second, the , in June 1944. The , was built in Newark, New Jersey, and was commissioned at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She was in commission from 1945 to 1976. After serving in the Pacific on post-war Western Pacific patrols, she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet in 1949 as the Cold War escalated. She was converted to a radar picket destroyer (DDR-715) in 1953, and was converted and modernized in 1964 to an all purpose destroyer with advanced sonar and submarine warfare weaponry. She patrolled the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean during the Cold War years, alternating operations between the Second Fleet homeported in Newport, Rhode Island, and Norfolk, Virginia, making 18 deployments with the Sixth Fleet including an extended deployment from 1972–1975 where she was homeported near Athens, Greece. Her missions included aiding earthquake victims in Volos Greece in 1955; supporting Eastern Mediterranean US coastal operations during the 1956 War between Israel and Egypt, and during the Lebanese crisis in 1958; participation in the Cuban Quarantine-Blockade in 1962; the pursuit of the hijacked Venezuelan freighter SS "Anzoategui" in 1963; coastal operations off the Dominican Republic and evacuation of American citizens during that county's revolution in 1965; participation in the search for the USS "Scorpion" in 1968; shadowing the Soviet Mediterranean Fleet during 1970–71, including intelligence gathering on the new Moskva class Soviet Helo-Guided Missile Cruiser-Carriers, and special operations in the Black Sea; coastal support operations off Crete during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974; additional Black Sea operations during her extended 1972–75 deployment; and continuous escort and defense operations with US carrier task forces in the Atlantic, Caribbean, and Mediterranean. By coincidence, the combined 42 years of service of the two completed destroyers which bore his name coincides approximately with Dr. Wood's 42-year U.S. Navy career. The USS "William M Wood" Association was formed in 1994 and currently has an active living shipmate directory of over 1,600 former crew of USS "William M. Wood" (DD-715). Eighteen annual reunions have been held by the association, and many of the active living shipmates regularly attend. The 19th reunion was to be held in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, October 14–18, 2015. The association has initiated a project named "Wood III" with the goal of requesting the U.S. Navy to continue the legacy of Dr. Wood and the U.S. Navy ship lineage for ships named in his honor, by naming another new Navy destroyer after Dr. Wood, thus enabling the shipmates of the "William M. Wood", including those who served during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War, to continue to honor Dr. Wood and to pass the baton during their lifetimes to the next generation of "Wood" sailors.

It was released as an airplay-only single from their fourth album, "Bleed Like Me", in May 2005. Following on from the "Billboard" Hot 100 success of lead single "Why Do You Love Me", "Bleed Like Me" was released by Geffen Records imprint Almo Sounds as the second North American single from the album. As an airplay-only track, "Bleed Like Me" reached the Modern Rock Tracks top thirty; four months later, remixes by DJ Eric Kupper received enough nightclub spins to peak in the top ten of the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. In 2007, "Bleed Like Me" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album "Absolute Garbage". "Bleed Like Me" was written in 2004 at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. It was one of the first songs the band wrote after reforming from a temporary three-month split in October 2003, with singer Shirley Manson overcoming writer's block to write the lyrics to the track. The song begun with Butch Vig creating both the acoustic riff that opens the track and title. Some time after he showed it to his bandmates, Manson wrote lyrics, inspired by a viewing of the movie "Thirteen", which she considered "so much like how my 13-year-old life was – apart from the unstable home life, which I didn't have." Butch Vig: "Musically it's very simple, it's basically this little hypnotic riff on the acoustic guitar and it builds a little bit, but the song never gets too big musically. It stays pretty simple. Really it's all about her vocals. She said 'I want to sound like a girls choir' and we're like 'Cool, let's just do it now'. She went in singing 'You should see my scars' and it just floored me. Still when I hear that the hairs on the back of my neck go up. It's really an amazing moment on the record." Manson said that the main theme of the song was "about how everybody's got a story to tell, and they've all got their own burden to carry around. Whether it's really a dramatic issue or whether it's really private it shapes you as a person. I think we're all guilty of believing that our problems are more important than somebody else's." Name-checking a number of her childhood friends; as well as J.T. LeRoy in the lyrics, Shirley recalled, "It's about a search for empathy. We can forget so easily that people are the same regardless of their sexuality, religion, colour, or moral values. Manson followed this up, "Regardless of the differences between people – their colour, creed, sexuality or how they behave and express themselves – essentially we are exactly the same. It's about how when you are dealing with other people you have to remember that they are all carrying with them their own baggage." Manson On May 25, Garbage confirmed a list of fourteen songs being worked on for the record, including "Sex Is Not the Enemy", and on December 14 confirmed that the song would be included on the finished album "Bleed Like Me". On March 28, 2005, Garbage performed the track on Canal+ "Album de la semaine" before debuting the song live on stage at the Paris Olympia the following day. On March 28, Garbage performed the single "Why Do You Love Me" on "Top of the Pops", "Napster Live" and "", they also performed "Bleed Like Me". On April 10 Garbage drummer Butch Vig confirmed to fans in Los Angeles that "Bleed Like Me" would be the second U.S. single taken from "Bleed Like Me"; and on May 9, "Bleed Like Me" was released to Modern Rock and Triple-A radio stations and debuted on the Modern Rock Tracks at #39 the following week. On May 8, the promo video for "Bleed Like Me" was added by Fuse, and the following week by MTVU and VH1. On May 12, Garbage perform "Bleed Like Me" on the "Late Show with David Letterman". and complete their North American club tour on May 14 in Baltimore. Garbage returned to North America to tour the "Bleed Like Me" single. On July 28 the band perform "Bleed Like Me" on "The Tonight Show". Remixes of "Bleed Like Me" by Eric Kupper debuts on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and on September 18 reaches the top 10, peaking at number 6. "Bleed Like Me" ended up being the final single release from "Bleed Like Me" in North America when Garbage disbanded on a self-imposed hiatus following the completion of their Australian tour, despite rumours of a North American release for both "Sex Is Not the Enemy" and "It's All Over But the Crying". On May 22, 2007 it was officially confirmed that "Bleed Like Me" was to be included on the band's greatest hits album "Absolute Garbage". The music video for "Bleed Like Me" was filmed on April 11 in the disused Linda Vista Hospital in Boyle Heights, Los Angeles and directed by Sophie Muller. During the filming, CNN interviewed the band and broadcast behind-the-scenes footage of the video. The video begins with Manson, as a nurse, reading medical records onto a dictation machine. She is then accompanied by Erikson, Marker, and Vig, as doctors, as they view patients on their rounds. Manson is then seen preparing a ward for use – opening curtains, preparing beds and medicine. Manson breaks into a file storage, where she reads her own medical file (placed in front of director Sophie Muller's file), and later speaks to her therapist, but she is startled by a raven. In the hospital's educational room, Manson stands at a lectern, which she pushes away to perform under disco lights. The video ends with Erikson, Marker and Vig watching Manson through a two-way mirror: she is their patient. Manson finishes her dictation and ejects the cassette from the machine. Using Nurse Ratched from "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" as a starting point, Manson's character was created from a mix of 1950s European nurse in costume, and evoking Helmut Newton's "strong yet vulnerable" photography subjects in her make-up. Manson herself wanted the video "to have a Hitchcockian feel" referencing his films "Marnie", "The Birds", and "Psycho", choosing graphic colours to enable to the video to "be as powerful as the song. I thought it was a brilliant concept". In 2006, the video was a "Director of the Year" nominee at the 15th Annual MVPA Awards. The video for "Bleed Like Me" was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD "Absolute Garbage". Ralphi Rosario's completed remix for "Bleed Like Me" was rejected for commercial release by Geffen; by August 28, 2005, the remix had leaked onto the internet. "Bleed Like Me" received a largely positive reception from critics, contrasted to the mixed reactions of the "Bleed Like Me" album. Johnny Sharp of "Kerrang!" felt that "Bleed Like Me" "almost seems to be mocking [Manson's] own tendency towards self-obsession"; while their Emma Johnston, in a review for the album wrote that "Bleed Like Me" was the "most striking" song of the set, adding that it was "the most poignant, empathic reflection of self-abuse since Manic Street Preachers' "4st 7lb" – over a gorgeous cello strewn background, [Shirley shows her] battle scars, worn with pride, there to show that she survived". Bev Lyons of "Daily Record (Scotland)" wrote that the song was "simplicity itself, dark and introspective" and was the stand-out track from the album, favourably comparing the track to Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side", as did "Guitar" magazine's Jenny Knight. Isabel Mohan of "Heat" complimented Shirley's "seductive" voice as "better than ever" (however two years later the same publications Laila Hassan described "Bleed Like Me" as "a little tiresome and dreary" in a review of "Absolute Garbage").

His father was Sir Egerton Coghill, 5th Baronet. Coghill was educated at Haileybury, and read English at Exeter College, Oxford. He became a fellow of the college and there is a small bust of him in the college chapel. He served in the Great War after 1917. In 1948, he was made Professor of Rhetoric at Gresham College. He was Merton Professor of English Literature in the University of Oxford from 1957 to 1966. He died in November 1980. His Chaucer and Langland translations were first made for BBC radio broadcasts. He was well known during his time as a theatrical producer and director in Oxford; he is noted particularly as the director of the Oxford University Dramatic Society 1949 production of "The Tempest". He was an associate of the literary discussion group "The Inklings" with other famous Oxford Dons such as J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, as well as Oxford alumnus Owen Barfield. In 1968, he collaborated with Martin Starkie to co-write the West-End and Broadway musical "Canterbury Tales". The musical was a great success internationally, receiving five Tony nominations. In 1973, the same team collaborated on a sequel 'The homeward Ride' comprising more of Chaucer's Tale. To date, this has been premiered only in Australia.

In North America, "Breaking Up the Girl" was serviced to alternative radio as the second single to be lifted from the album. The single release coincided with "Rolling Stone" publishing their critics' Albums of the Year list, on which "Beautiful Garbage" was ranked the sixth best release of 2001. "Breaking Up the Girl" was licensed out as the theme tune to "Is It College Yet?", the final episode of the long-running animated series "Daria", which premiered on MTV as a TV movie in January 2002. "Breaking Up the Girl" was subsequently released internationally in April 2002, where it supported the band's UK and European tour. The single reached the top forty in both Australia and United Kingdom. "Breaking Up the Girl" was written and recorded by Garbage between April 2000 and May 2001 at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during the year-long writing sessions for "Beautiful Garbage". At some point in this period of time, Shirley Manson had overheard the rest of the band working on the body of the song, and was inspired to write the melody and lyrics. During the development of the song, Garbage experimented with Beatles-like harmonies and ad-libs over the coda. and layered a vocal from Manson onto a matching guitar part. "We sampled her going 'aah' and Duke played guitar," Butch Vig explained,"and that made it sound like a weird little melodic quote, not necessarily a vocal part". Although it was one of the album's straightforward rock songs, Garbage couldn't agree on the bass/kickdrum pattern in the chorus, trying various transmutations of a one-bar phrase. Using his Fender Precision Bass and pick, session musician Daniel Shulman created a McCartney-esque bass movement for the verse. Vig felt that the strumming of the guitar chords gave the song a Big Star feel. A decade earlier, when her Scottish band Angelfish were struggling, Manson had lived in South Queensferry where her friends included Andrew Greig, the poet Iain Banks, Duncan McLean and Alan Warner. At the time she felt washed up, and became reclusive with depression."It was Andrew who came by every morning and knocked on my door. He forced me out of bed and dragged me along the beach. He'd say "If you just keep going along the beach you'll get back on track", Manson later recalled. "He kept me moving. And I did get back on track. Very shortly after that, I got the call to go and join Garbage". Manson credited Greig with saving her career, a debt she tacitly acknowledged by quoting the line "I'm afraid there is much to be afraid of" from his 1994 long poem "Western Swing". Lyrically Manson felt that "Breaking Up the Girl" was "a cautionary tale. It's basically saying the world we're living in is harsh and you've got to live in the moment. Focus on the now. If there's something in your life that isn't good then get rid of them." Duke Erikson expanded, "the light, poppy, melodic feel to the song belies the seriousness of the lyrics". Interscope Records released "Breaking Up The Girl" as the second North American single from "Beautiful Garbage", to Modern Rock and Triple A radio formats in November 2001. Garbage were booked on the support slot on U2's Elevation Tour throughout the Fall; the band then spent December promoting the "Beautiful Garbage" album in the United States, recording a VH1 "Behind The Music" special (for broadcast after the new year) and performing "Breaking Up the Girl" on "The Tonight Show" on December 12. After the "Daria" premiere, Interscope re-serviced "Breaking Up the Girl" to radio in February 2002 where it peaked at #18 on the Triple A chart. The UK release of "Breaking Up the Girl" was scheduled to follow the band's concert tour in April 2002. The band performed the song on "" prior to the commencement of the live dates, which ran for eight consecutive nights. On April 8, Mushroom Records issued the single as a 3×CD single set backed with three b-sides: "Confidence", an out-take from "Beautiful Garbage" and featured drums performed by Matt Chamberlain; "Happiness Pt.2", a discarded demo reworked by Butch Vig while he was recovering from a Hepatitis infection the previous year; and a cover version of Velvet Underground's "Candy Says", featuring a bass guitar part by the band's engineer Billy Bush and recorded during tour rehearsals. The three tracks were spread out over the three discs, as were an acoustic version and a QuickTime music video of the title track, and two remixes of "Breaking Up the Girl" produced by Brothers In Rhythm and Timo Maas; and a version of "Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go!)" by Eli Janney. The single peaked at #27 on the UK Singles Chart. The following week, "Pepsi Chart Show" broadcast a live recording of Garbage performing "Breaking Up the Girl" on-stage at the Brixton Academy during the tour, while "Top of the Pops" broadcast a performance of the single pre-recorded by the band the previous November. In Europe, PIAS Recordings issued "Breaking Up the Girl" across the continent as a five track enhanced CD maxi collecting together both remixes, "Use Me" (an album out-take released earlier in the United Kingdom and Australia on the b-side of "Cherry Lips") and an enhanced music video section; as a two-track CD single backed with a radio edit of the Timo Maas remix; and an exclusive 12" vinyl format of multiple remixes. Garbage returned to tour European rock festivals in June 2002 (follow-up single "Shut Your Mouth" was released to support these dates). Prior to these shows, Garbage performed a special concert for Los 40 Principales and completed a mini-tour of Spain sponsored by telecom company Movistar in Salamanca, Madrid, Bilbao and Barcelona. During this time, "Breaking Up the Girl" reached #33 on the Spanish airplay chart. Following up Garbage's first Australian top ten hit ("Cherry Lips"), FMR scheduled the release of "Breaking Up the Girl" to begin low-key, with the remixes impacting clubs from March 1, 2002, eight weeks in advance of the single's street date. The song was serviced to Australian radio stations and the music video to television networks on March 25. FMR issued "Breaking Up the Girl" to stores on April 29. The single was issued as 2×CD single set, backed with "Candy Says", "Confidence" and Eli Janney's remix of "Cherry Lips" on the first disc, and the acoustic version, Brothers in Rhythm and Timo Maas mixes on a limited edition second disc. At the start of May, "Breaking Up the Girl" debuted on the ARIA Charts at #19, the band's second single to reach the top twenty in Australia. The single also debuted at #2 on the ARIA Alternative chart. FMR launched a television ad campaign during May, with heavy emphasis on "Breaking Up the Girl"; "Beautiful Garbage" recharted and reclimbed the album charts chart to #27. At the end of June, "Breaking Up the Girl" eventually bowed out of the Top 100 at #96 after an eight-week run. In New Zealand, "Beautiful Garbage" rebounded on the RIANZ album chart during April, reaching #16."Breaking Up the Girl" did not make the RIANZ singles chart. Garbage began a two-month North American tour in mid-April, which was routed into the SoCal area and into Mexico by June; at that time "Breaking Up the Girl" went into heavy rotation on MTV en Español. Garbage's tour ended at the start of June with a concert at Mexico City's National Auditorium; "Breaking Up the Girl" was subsequently released in Mexico through Universal as a five-track CD maxi. The promotional video for "Breaking Up the Girl" was directed by Francis Lawrence and shot over December 5/6, 2001 in Los Angeles. Two version of the video were made. The first version released contained footage lifted from the "Daria" series mixed with montage footage of Garbage performing and shots of the band filming the video. The video was premiered on January 21, 2002 on MTV during the intermission to the first showing of the "Daria" movie "Is It College Yet?". MTV Europe playlisted the video at the end of March. The second released version, which became the main edit of the video, which was broadcast worldwide from February 2002. The video began with a CGI shot of a shattered rose, which disintegrated as the band appear. While Manson features heavily during the verses, the band perform together during the choruses. For the latter part of the video, all of the montage shots of Garbage disintegrate like the rose at the beginning, and the video ends with the rose reforming. The pace of the video is kept up using aggressive editing and cutting between shots filmed with zoom and fisheye lenses. The international edit of the "Breaking Up the Girl" music video was first made commercially available in QuickTime format on the CD-ROM enhanced section of the "Breaking Up the Girl" singles. The video, like the song, did not appear on 2007's "Absolute Garbage". The CD format of "Beautiful Garbage" contained an enhanced element where users could remix four tracks from the album, of which "Breaking Up the Girl" was one of. Created in conjunction with Sonic Foundry, using a customized version of their drag-and-drop "ACID Pro" music sequencer software, the remixes utilized samples and loops cut direct from the album masters. The enhanced section could be accessed when the user was online; a simplified version of the software featuring only "Androgyny" loops was accessible when the user was offline. In 2007, the Timo Maas remix of "Breaking Up the Girl" was remastered, edited and included on the "Absolute Garbage" greatest hits album bonus disc "Garbage Mixes". Four rejected mixes by Jimmy Caulty and Black Dog Productions surfaced in May 2011. "Breaking Up the Girl" received a mixed response from contemporary music journalists. Paul Elliot of "Q", who had the chance to listen to the track as soon as it was mixed, described the song as being "redolent of vintage Blondie". Jerry Ewing of "Classic Rock" wrote that the song was "wonderful, guitar-based rock, with a magic sprinkling of melody" "This serene delight showcases Garbage's softer side," wrote "Sunday Mail"'s Billy Sloan, "Its soft sound contrasts against the spurned vocals; a testament to the chameleon-like style that is the glory of Garbage" A reviewer for "Smash Hits!" wrote, "[It's] not as instantly memorable as ["Cherry Lips"]... this radio-friendly rock-tinged pop will have your toes tapping away to the beat in no time". Chuck Taylor of "Billboard" compared the song to Republica's "Ready to Go" writing "this track conjures up images... of Manson frolicking in a daisy patch. It's all back to Earth with the lyric, which pretty much calls the subject to a loser for hurting a girl. You've been warned, now just enjoy the pace." Jason Arnopp of "Kerrang!" described "Breaking Up the Girl" as "[It] glides along sultry, sad and dreamy, driven by a practically recognisable acoustic guitar." </doc> <doc id="2340685" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340685" title="Good (Goodshirt album)"> Good (Goodshirt album) Good is the 2001 debut studio album by New Zealand four piece pop/rock band Goodshirt.

Howard. It was originally published in the magazine "Weird Tales" in November 1932, then again in 1975 in a collection of Howard's short stories, "Worms of the Earth". The story features one of Howard's recurring protagonists, Bran Mak Morn, a legendary king of the Picts. Bran Mak Morn, King of the Picts, vows vengeance on the Roman governor Titus Sulla after witnessing the crucifixion of a fellow Pict. He seeks forbidden aid from the Worms of the Earth, a race of creatures who Bran Mak Morn's ancestors had banished from their kingdom. They were once men, but millennia of living underground caused them to become monstrous and semi-reptilian. Searching for a contact with these creatures, Bran Mak Morn encounters a witch who lives in a secluded hut, shunned by her neighbors, who was born of a sexual encounter between one of the "Worms" and a human woman. The witch's price for helping him is "one night of love" which her human half craves - as men in general are repelled by her reptilian traits. Bran Mak Morn, though also himself repelled, agrees to pay this price. In exchange, she tells him of a barrow where "The Black Stone", a religious item of great importance to the "Worms" is hidden. Stealing the Black Stone is a highly risky enterprise - if caught by the "Worms", Bran Mak Morn would die in torment "as no man had died for a thousand years". However, the barrow is unguarded and he manages to carry out his theft by hiding the Stone at the bottom of a lake. To get it back, the "Worms" agree to deliver Sulla to him. This they proceed to do, undermining and destroying a strong Roman fortress known as "Trajan's Tower" and snatching the Roman governor into their underground tunnels. Mak Morn intended, once Sulla was delivered, to challenge him to a duel to the death. However, Sulla's mind is broken from his contact with the horrific Worms of the Earth and Bran Mak Morn slays him in mercy rather than vengeance, realizing that some weapons are too foul to use, even against Rome. In a 1932 letter to August Derleth, Clark Ashton Smith, discussing the current issue of "Weird Tales", stated that "Howard’s “Worms of the Earth” seems to be the one real first-rater." Robert Weinberg called "Worms of the Earth" "an effective blend of horror and adventure", and said it was one of Howard's "best works". A two-part and thirty-seven page comic strip adaptation in black and white, adapted by Roy Thomas and penciled by Tim Conrad and Barry Windsor-Smith, was published by Marvel Comics' Curtis Magazines brand in December 1976 and February 1977, in issues #16 and #17 of "The Savage Sword of Conan". A trade paperback version in full color was published by Cross Plains Comics/Wandering Star in October 2000. Twice in "Worms of the Earth" Howard mentions the "black gods" of R'lyeh, a fictional city created by his friend and correspondent H. P. Lovecraft. Also mentioned is a water monster "Dagon", which is a historical Philistine god mentioned in a fictional context in several stories by Lovecraft. Howard had previously dealt with beings similar to the titular Worms of the Earth in an earlier short story, "The Children of the Night", set in Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. </doc> <doc id="2340697" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340697" title="Hong Kong Red Cross"> Hong Kong Red Cross The Hong Kong Red Cross () is the national Red Cross society of Hong Kong as part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It was established officially on 12 July 1950 as a branch of the British Red Cross Society in Hong Kong. Since 1 July 1997, upon the transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to the People's Republic of China, the Hong Kong Red Cross has changed its affiliation to become a special branch of the Red Cross Society of China, but remains autonomous from it. Unlike other Red Cross and Red Crescent societies worldwide, which are notable for their humanitarian effort, Hong Kong Red Cross is better known for blood transfusion in Hong Kong. This may be due to a few disasters threatening and political turmoils in the territory, also its long history of service from 1952. The blood transfusion service runs under the Hospital Authority. In lack of need in relief services in the territory, the society runs a range of humanitarian services to care for the underprivileged, such as schooling for children in hospitals, organising voluntary services in the ageing communities, organising uniform groups for youths and adults, and conducting first aid courses. In the case of disasters in neighbouring regions, the society raises funding and sends relief forces. In occasional floods in eastern China, earthquakes in China, Indian Ocean tsunami, the staff and volunteers from the Hong Kong Red Cross attended. In the early height of incoming Vietnamese refugees, the society also set up services for them in the 1980s. The society is largely managed by volunteers with some paid staff. For its development, the society organises both uniformed and non-uniformed units for volunteers of all ages. By age, the uniform groups are divided into: Red Cross Youth Units, or "RCY" (formerly known as Cadet Units until 1997), as members of the International Red Cross Movement, aim at protecting life and health, serving the community and putting the spirit of Humanity in Action. These uniformed units are attached to secondary schools, youth centres and Hong Kong Red Cross Divisional Headquarters, and members are usually aged from 12 to 17. The youth uniform units are notable in Hong Kong because of its widespread in secondary schools in the territory. The uniform units are educated with the spirit of Red Cross and the skills of first aid, drilling and others. There are five Red Cross Divisional Headquarters located in different geographical position in Hong Kong. Two of them are located in New Territories, two of them in Kowloon and the rest in Hong Kong Island. Head Office enacts a coordinator between all divisional headquarters. Each headquarters hold a fraction of Youth Units. These lists are available in the intranet system of each headquarters. The major events include: Non-uniform units are named Adult Volunteer Groups. They are for members who commit less intensively, as they normally work regular day jobs as well. </doc> <doc id="2340714" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340714" title="John Ringham"> John Ringham John Henry Ringham (10 February 1928 – 20 October 2008) was a British character actor of both television and stage who appeared in over a hundred screen appearances in a wide variety of roles. He is known for his role in the 1980s sitcom "Just Good Friends" as Norman Warrender. Ringham was born in Cheltenham where his father was a travelling book salesman. He was educated at the Cheltenham Grammar School for Boys (now known as Pate's Grammar School). As a teenager he was a member of a drama group run by a retired professional actor. He was then called up for National Service and served from 1946 until 1948 as an officer in Egypt and Mandatory Palestine. After leaving the army he spent four years as a member of a touring theatre company based in Gloucestershire called the Compass Players. He appeared throughout BBC Television's Shakespeare adaptation "An Age of Kings" in 1960, most prominently as Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the brother of Henry the Fifth. Other appearances over the years include several parts in "Z-Cars"; "Softly, Softly", and "Barlow at Large"; "Flambards"; "Poldark"; the "War and Peace" dramatisation in 1972; "Birds of a Feather"; "The Bill"; "Bless Me Father"; "Taggart"; "Bergerac"; "The Tripods"; "Juliet Bravo"; "Minder"; "All Creatures Great and Small"; "Dixon of Dock Green"; "Are You Being Served?"; "Catweazle"; "Up Pompeii!"; "The Avengers"; "The Piglet Files", "When the Boat Comes In", "London's Burning" and "Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em". In "Dad's Army" he played two different characters — Private Bracewell in the pilot (he was set to become a major recurring character, but this was later dropped), then Captain Bailey in four later episodes. He appeared in the long-running show "Doctor Who" three times, first as the bloodthirsty priest Tlotoxl in the story "The Aztecs" (1964). He returned in the stories "The Smugglers" (1966) and "Colony in Space" (1971). He was also a playwright and the author of three books, including a biography of the composer George Frideric Handel. Ringham died of cancer in 2008 aged 80. </doc> <doc id="2340719" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340719" title="BRU"> BRU BRU may stand for: </doc> <doc id="2340720" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340720" title="Fiji Baby"> Fiji Baby Fiji Baby (2004) is the second studio album from New Zealand four piece Goodshirt. </doc> <doc id="2340734" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340734" title="Rita (roller coaster)"> Rita (roller coaster) Rita, formerly known as Rita: Queen of Speed, is a launched roller coaster located in the Dark Forest section of Alton Towers amusement park in Staffordshire Moorlands, England. Designed by Intamin, the Accelerator Coaster model opened to the public on 1 April 2005. It features an acceleration from 0 to in 2.5 seconds. The ride is loosely-themed to a drag racing concept, which partly changed when the section of the park transformed from "Ug Land" into the "Dark Forest" in 2010. It is now themed as an abandoned drag racer that is used as the escape cart to escape the Dark Forest. In 2006, a similar launched roller coaster opened at Thorpe Park, called Stealth. It is also designed by Intamin and is faster than Rita, reaching speeds at 80 mph. The ride was temporarily renamed "Camilla - Queen of Speed" on 9 April 2005 to celebrate the marriage of Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles. This simply involved banner signage to notify guests of the name change. "Rita" was Alton Towers' new attraction for the 2005 season. The ride starts with the train racing forward from the station area, accelerating from 0 to in 2.5 seconds, and negotiates high speed corners and air-time hills (the layout is a figure-of-8) before then reaching the brake run parallel with the station. The track is painted red but the higher parts of the track are painted green due to a rule which states that no roller coaster should be visible above the tree line. The ride has since been partly re-themed to support the theme of nearby Thirteen which opened in March 2010. The ride control cabin and entrance have been refurbished to look 'engulfed' by the branches of the Dark Forest area. As well as the control cabin and Rita tyres being rethemed to suit the Dark Forest, the cars have been rethemed with a darker grey tint to the bottom of the cars with forest stains over the flames to make it fit. It still has the blue and purple cars with flames but with a tint of grey to make Rita look damaged by the supernatural forest. The voiceover heard before the ride launches is also changed to incorporate a more spooky theme. As opposed to an American-accented motor racing commentary-style voice counting down to the start of a drag race, it is now a sinister, foreboding voice ordering passengers to "Keep your head back! Hold on tight! You MUST escape! Go! Go! Go!". In September 2004 UG Land was stripped of almost all of its attractions including The UG Bugs, The Bone Shaker and Lava Lump preparing for a major new ride. The only rides that remained were the Corkscrew and the UG Swinger. On 1 April 2005 Rita Queen of Speed opened to the public and 'UG Land and the Thunder Rock Rally' was formed, incorporating the new ride, Corkscrew, and a number of other rides which would be removed in the following years. In September 2009, following a change of the area to the Dark Forest, the "Queen of Speed" suffix was dropped from the ride's name, and Rita (as it is now known) received a retheme, with a redecorated entrance, queue line, station, control room and cars. On the morning of 24 July 2012, the ride's launch cable snapped during testing while attached to an empty train. This also happened in 2005. No injuries were reported, but the incident was similar to the 2009 failure of the Xcelerator rollercoaster's launch cable in the United States. The ride re-opened on 26 July 2012. </doc> <doc id="2340735" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340735" title="Landolfi"> Landolfi Landolfi is an Italian surname, which is derived from the given name Landolfo or Landulf, which in turn is composed of the German words "land" ("land") and "wulf" ("wolf").

In 1996, the track was remixed by Nellee Hooper and Marius de Vries for the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's modernised "William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet" film adaptation. The remix of "#1 Crush" peaked at number one on "Billboard"s Hot Modern Rock Tracks, where it stayed for four weeks, and is Garbage's sole number-one entry on any US singles chart to date. "#1 Crush" was the first of two hit singles from the "Romeo + Juliet" soundtrack; "Lovefool" by The Cardigans continued the success of the compilation. In 1997, "#1 Crush" was later nominated for Best Song from a Movie at the MTV Movie Awards. In 2007, the remix of "#1 Crush" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album "Absolute Garbage". "#1 Crush" was written and recorded between March, 1994 and May, 1995 during sessions between band members Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in either Marker's basement recording studio or at their own Smart Studios in Madison. Manson was concerned that listeners wouldn't realise that the song was about a stalker: "It's about somebody who wasn't "quite right". The song however were slightly autobiographical. Everybody's felt obsessive about something or somebody in their life. I've felt "crazy" about somebody before," she explained, "That feeling - usually when you've split up with somebody - when you're absolutely obsessed with what they are doing. It's all to do with being pathetic". Reflecting on the lyrics, Manson felt, "All real love is a form of obsession. If you love someone more than anything else, that degree of exclusivity requires an abnormal amount of passion and care. And that can be positive," contrasting with the protagonist of "#1 Crush, "It's just that keeping it short of unhealthy, short of violence, really requires a bit of moderation. You can't let something like that take over "all" of your thought processes". Butch Vig later described "#1 Crush" as "disturbing". Garbage's debut international single release "Vow" featured "#1 Crush" on the B-side, and was released in Europe, South Africa and Australasia in June 1995. The August re-release for the United Kingdom saw the track order reversed, with accompanying B-side "Subhuman" released in its own right, with "#1 Crush" remaining as its B-side, and "Vow" being added as a CD single bonus track. In Japan, both "#1 Crush" and "Subhuman" were included as bonus tracks on the Japanese pressings of the band's debut album (titled "G" in Japan). At the end of 1995, BMG France included "#1 Crush" on an album sampler titled "Rare Track Collection" to give away free with copies of the debut album purchased in Virgin Megastores. Nellee Hooper remixed "#1 Crush" for inclusion on the "Romeo + Juliet" soundtrack, working with producers Marius de Vries and Jim Abbiss. In addition to downplaying the guitars and reworking the percussion and synth elements of the song, Hooper added a distorted vocal sample from Madonna's 1995 single "Bedtime Story". The "Romeo + Juliet" soundtrack was released in North America on October 29, 1996, ahead of the movie which opened in cinemas on November 1; "#1 Crush" was the album opener, and began to receive airplay at alternative radio. "Romeo + Juliet" debuted at number 44 on the "Billboard" 200. A week later "#1 Crush" debuted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 17 and on the Hot 100 Airplay at number 49. The song had received airplay at 71 monitored radio stations across the United States, and had become the driving force behind the soundtrack which shot up to number 12 on the album chart. In its second week, "#1 Crush" broke into the Modern Rock top 10 (at number eight). At the start of 1997, "#1 Crush" hit number one on the Modern Rock chart. The same week, the song reached a peak of number 29 on the airplay chart. Because "#1 Crush" was an album cut, and would not be commercially available as a domestic single, it was ineligible to chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100. Due to the song's runaway success, Garbage contemplated filming a music video for it. The song stayed at the top Modern Rock position for an entire month, before dropping to number two at the start of February. Top 40 radio picked up on "#1 Crush" and registered a single week on the Top 40 Mainstream at number 39. During this period, the "Romeo + Juliet" soundtrack hit number two on the albums chart; the band's debut album also rebounded from the lower-70s into the top 50. By the end of its chart-run in May 1997, "#1 Crush" had spent a total of 16 weeks on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and 22 on the Modern Rock chart. "#1 Crush" generated a mostly positive response from music critics and radio programmers. Don O'Neal, PD of KFRR in Fresno, California, praised Garbage for following up the mass-appeal crossover "Stupid Girl" with the "almost gothic" "#1 Crush". Actor Lee Pace performed "#1 Crush" in a drag show in the 2003 film "Soldier's Girl". In 2004, "#1 Crush" became the theme tune to the British television series "Hex". Debbie Gallagher sings the song in the 2012 "Shameless" episode "I'll Light a Candle For You Every Day". The song also appeared in the 2014 episode of "True Blood" titled 'Death Is Not The End'. Over two minutes of the song was featured in opening segment of the season 1 "La Femme Nikita" episode ""Obsessed"".

The elder Lucius Murena was notable for having played an important role in the Roman victory against the forces of Mithridates VI of Pontus at the Battle of Chaeronea in 86 BC during the First Mithridatic War and for engaging in another war, the Second Mithridatic War (83–81 BC), against Mithridates in Asia Minor without the authorisation of the Roman senate. The younger Lucius Murena was an officer in the Third Mithridatic War, a governor of Gallia Transalpina in 64-63 BC and a consul in 62 BC. He stood trial because of charges of electoral bribery. The cognomen 'Murena' is supposedly derived from the fondness of a familial ancestor for lampreys ("murenae"). The family "gens" was the "Licinii". The elder Murena was a lieutenant of Lucius Cornelius Sulla during the First Mithridatic War ((89–85 BC) with Mithridates VI of Pontus. He participated in the Battle of Chaeronea of 86 BC. Sulla encamped near Chaeronea, close to the camp of Archelaüs, the commander of the enemy. He left Murena behind with one legion and two cohorts to face the enemy, should they prepare for battle, and went to Chaeronea, where the Romans had a garrison. Some of the townsfolk offered to go and cut off the enemy at nerby Thurium. Sulla agreed, returned to his camp and prepared for battle, putting Murena in charge of the left wing. The Chaeroneans were routed and Murena received some of the fugitives. During the battle Murena was attacked and Sulla sent four cohorts to help him. Later in the battle he set out to help him himself. However, Murena had already gained the upper hand and Sulla joined him in the pursuit of the fugitives. In a note on Lucius Licinius Lucullus, Pseudo-Aurelius Victor wrote that he gained the fleet of Mithridates and king Ptolemy of Egypt for Sulla through Murena. Presumably the Ptolemy in question was Ptolemy IX. At the end of that war, Sulla left Murena in Asia Minor in charge of the two legions formerly controlled by Gaius Flavius Fimbria as a legatus to watch over the region. We can deduct from Appian's account of this war in his "The Mithridatic Wars", that Murena had been given the command of Phrygia, which had been annexed to the Kingdom of Pergamon in 188 BC, Galatia, a client state of Rome, and the kingdom of Cappadocia, which was a Roman ally. Under the terms of the Treaty of Dardanos, Sulla had left Mithridates in control of his kingdom of Pontus. Murena undertook an unauthorised war against Mithridates, the Second Mithridatic War (83-81 BC). In 83 BC Murena attacked Comana, a town which belonged to Mithridates, because of suspicions that the latter was preparing for war against the Romans. Mithridates was fitting a fleet and raising an army to deal with a rebellion by the Colchians and the tribes around the Cimmerian Bosphorus. It was the scale of these preparations and the fact that he had not restored the whole of Cappadocia to their king, Ariobarzanes I, who was a Roman ally, which led to this impression. Mithridates sent envoys to invoke the peace treaty. Murena replied that he did not see any treaties because Sulla had not written it down before he returned to Greece. He then began looting and then returned to Cappadocia to winter there. Mithridates sent envoys to Rome to complain. In 82 BC Murena seized 400 villages which belonged to Mithridates, who chose to wait for the return of the ambassadors, rather than retaliate. Murena returned to Phrygia and Galatia loaded with the plunder. He was reached by a messenger of the senate who ordered him to stop the hostilities because Mithridates had not broken the peace treaty. Murena ignored this and invaded Mithridates’ territory. The latter thought that this was done under the order of Rome and retaliated. Roman villages were attacked and loot was taken. Murena was then defeated by Mithridates in a tough battle and fled to Phrygia. Mithridates drove all the Roman garrisons out of Cappadocia. Aulus Gabinius was sent to reinforce the order to stop fighting and to meet Mithridates and Ariobarzanes I to reconcile them. Murena was recalled to Rome. Murena was awarded a triumph for a victory over king Mithridates in 81 BC. Presumably this was for his role in the victory at the Battle of Chaeronea. The younger Murena began his public career as quaestor in c.75 BC. When the Third Mithridatic War began in 73 BC, Murena was appointed "legatus" for the commander Lucius Licinius Lucullus, a fellow Licinius. Murena served for several years in the East under Lucullus and was in charge of a legion. In 65 BC, Murena was urban praetor and made himself popular by the magnificence of the games he provided. After his praetorship, Murena was the governor of Gallia Transalpina in 64 BC and part of 63 BC. On his way there he levied some troops in Umbria. Cicero said that "[t]he republic enabled him to display his liberality, which he did so effectually as to engage in his interest many tribes which are connected with the municipalities of that district [Umbria]." He returned to Rome from Gaul before the end of his term to stand for the consulship for 62 BC and left his brother, Gaius Murena, in charge of the province as his deputy. Cicero said that his "conduct in his province procured him the affection of many influential men, and a great accession of reputation" and that "he contrived by his equity and diligence to enable many of our citizens to recover debts which they had entirely despaired of."” In 63 BC Cicero managed to have Murena elected as one of the consuls for 62 BC instead of Lucius Sergius Catiline. However, before entering office he was accused of electoral bribery by Servius Sulpicius Rufus, whom he had defeated in the election, even though he was a famous jurist (he attained the consulate ten years later). The prosecution case was presented by Marcus Porcius Cato the younger. According to Plutarch, Cato heard that there had been electoral bribery and swore that he would prosecute the briber. He did not pursue Decimus Junius Silanus, Murena's consular colleague, because he was the husband of his sister Servilia. He persecuted Lucius Murena. Murena appointed a man to keep Cato under observation as there was a law according to which the defendant could do this so that there could be no secret about the evidence gathered by the prosecutor. However, this man saw Cato’s probity and told Cato that if on a given day he told him that he was not pursuing the case, he would take his word for it and go away. Cicero, the consul and Murena's advocate, took advantage of Cato's like of stoic philosophers to joke about their paradoxes. Cato said that he was amusing. Cicero, too, mentioned this episode. Murena was defended by Marcus Licinius Crassus (who three years later became one of the men of the first triumvirate), Quintus Hortensius, and Sulpicius' friend Cicero (in the extant speech "For Murena") and was acquitted. It possible, however, that Murena was in fact guilty. Much of our information about Murena's life and career comes from the contents of Cicero's speech. In the trial Murena was reproached for having adorned the triumph of his father with military gifts and sharing his triumph with him and was accused to have lived in luxury while he was on the military campaign. With regard to the triumph, Cicero argued that this was legitimate because he had served in the war under the command of his father. He added that the fact that he served in a war left no room for speaking ill of him. Murena was also accused of being a dancer, which characterised him as a person less dignity. Cicero dismissed the relevance of this. He also dismissed the suggestion that the dignity of Sulpicius’ status was higher than that of Murena and made favourable points in regard to Murena’s. He also argued that Murena’s electoral success was also due to the return of the soldiers from the war, who remembered his largesse when he was serving with them. During his consulship, Murena and Decimus Junius Silanus, his consular colleague, passed a law (the "lex Junia Licinia") which enforced more strictly, with greater punishment for not complying, the provisions of the "lex Caecilia Didia" of 98 BC, which provided that: 1) laws should be promulgated (notified publicly) a "trinundium" (either three Roman eight-day weeks or tertiae nundinae, on the third market-day, 17 days) before they were proposed to the "comitia" (the popular assembly); 2) leges saturae ("stuffed" laws), that is, statutes dealing with heterogeneous subject matter, were forbidden. Thus, a single statute could not be a collection of unrelated measures. It further enacted that, in order to prevent forgery, a copy of every proposed statute should be deposited before witnesses in the "aerarium" before it was put to the vote of the popular assembly. </doc> <doc id="2340770" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340770" title="Murena"> Murena Murena is a name ("cognomen") used by a Roman plebeian family from Lanuvium belonging to the "gens Licinia". It is supposed to be derived from the fondness of a family member for lampreys ("murenae"). The most prominent members of the family were Lucius Licinius Murena father and son. The father was a lieutenant of Sulla in the first Mithridatic War and played an important role in the Battle of Chaeronea. The son was the governor of Gallia Transalpina in 64 BC and part of 63 BC and consul in 62 BC. When he went to Rome to stand for the consulship, he left his brother Gaius Murena in charge of the province as his deputy. He was defended by Cicero in 63 BC against a charge of bribery in the extant speech "For Murena". </doc> <doc id="2340781" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340781" title="James Ellis (actor)"> James Ellis (actor) James Ellis (15 March 1931 – 8 March 2014) was a Northern Irish actor and stage director with a career stretching over sixty years. Originally a stage actor and director in Northern Ireland, he moved to London in the early 1960s. After gaining recognition in Great Britain through the "Z-Cars" (1962–78) police series on BBC1, he appeared in many other television and film roles. He was also a translator. Ellis was born in Belfast and attended the Methodist College Belfast and later studied at Queen's University Belfast and trained at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School. He began to act with the Belfast-based Ulster Group Theatre in 1952. He first appeared in a revival of the Louis D'Alton play, "They Got What They Wanted" (1947). Ellis became established as the company's young male lead in such plays as "April in Assagh", where he was cast as McFettridge (1954), "Is the Priest at Home?" as O'Grady (1954), and "The Diary of Anne Frank" as Peter van Daan (1957). While continuing as an actor in the main company, he also undertook the management of the group's summer theatre in the seaside town of Larne, north of Belfast. Ellis's most important roles for the group include the lead role of Christy Mahon in a production of J.M. Synge's "The Playboy of the Western World" in 1957. Ellis had a major part to play in the staging of Sam Thompson's even more controversial "Over the Bridge" (1960). In December 1958 Ellis had been appointed the Group Theatre's Director of Productions, but he resigned this position in July 1959 to direct the production of Thompson's play, which was to be staged by a group of actors and directors who had quit the Group in protest over its decision to withdraw "Over the Bridge", which had been in rehearsals, after the Group's board deemed the play too inflammatory. Ellis soon left Northern Ireland for London, where his first break came when he was cast as Dandy Jordan in the BBC TV production of Stewart Love's "Randy Dandy", which aired on 14 September 1961, an "Angry" play that was deemed so controversial and sexually charged that the BBC gave a warning before the transmission that it was "unsuitable for people of a nervous disposition". His success as Dandy made him a sought-after actor and led to subsequent roles with the BBC and ITV, including as Philip in the BBC production of Stewart Love's "The Sugar Cube" (transmitted 21 June 1961) and ultimately his role as Bert Lynch in "Z-Cars" (1962–78). In this police series, set in the fictional Newtown in Lancashire, his character rose from the rank of PC to Inspector over the series run. Ellis appeared in 629 episodes of this series, an all-time record for any actor's appearances in a TV detective/police series. The impact of "Z-Cars" was such that he became a household name in this era. From 1982, he portrayed Norman Martin, the violent and troubled father, in the "Billy" trilogy of plays by Graham Reid, all of which were broadcast as part of the "Play for Today" series. The first of the plays, "Too Late to Talk to Billy", was followed by "A Matter of Choice for Billy" (1983) and "A Coming to Terms for Billy" (1984). A postscript to the trilogy, "Lorna", was broadcast in 1987. In the mid-1980s Ellis was a member of the team of interviewers on "Afternoon Plus", produced by Thames Television. He appeared in "Doctor Who", "In Sickness and in Health", "Ballykissangel", "Playing the Field", "One By One" and the cult sitcom "Nightingales", with Robert Lindsay and David Threlfall. In Antonia Bird's "Priest" (1994), from a screenplay by Jimmy McGovern, he played Father Ellerton.

In both portrayals Murdoc is an assassin and frequent antagonist of both series. Murdoc is played by Michael Des Barres. Murdoc is an assassin working for the Homicide International Trust, an international group of assassins. He appears in a total of nine episodes, being the most frequent antagonist of the series and one of the very few to make recurring appearances. Murdoc is Angus MacGyver's most frequent opponent, a member of Homicide International Trust (HIT) and master assassin who never fails – except when MacGyver gets involved. Murdoc is an accomplished pianist, a master of disguise, as well as creative and highly skilled in the use of booby traps. He is also fond of heavy weapons, including flamethrowers, bazookas, and dynamite. Murdoc's signature for each hit is to take photographs of his victim at the moment of their death. MacGyver first encountered Murdoc in 1980: Murdoc (disguised as a woman named Sarah) was being followed by Peter Thornton, and (after originally helping Murdoc escape by mistake) MacGyver saves Pete (and himself) from being blown up by two of Murdoc's helpers. Their interaction convinces Pete to hire MacGyver to work with him at the DXS. At the end of this encounter, Murdoc had apparently been killed. Murdoc's next appearance is seven years later; he has resurfaced to take revenge on MacGyver for foiling his plans during their first encounter. Murdoc's revenge scheme not only fails, but once again results in his apparent death. This became a recurring theme with the character: resurfacing after an apparent death, only to fail and appear to die again. This "near death" cycle occurred a total of six times throughout the series. He has survived, among other things, falling down an abandoned mine shaft, driving off a cliff in a car that exploded upon impact, having a collapsing building fall on him, being electrocuted and falling into a pool of flaming water, and falling thousands of feet off the sheer face of a mountain. His body was never found. Murdoc always screams "MacGyver!" at the moment of his "death", except in episode "Halloween Knights", where he and MacGyver act as allies. When Murdoc tried to retire following his repeated failures to deal with MacGyver, HIT refused to let him go, instead putting a hit out on him and eventually holding his sister hostage in an attempt to bring him in. To rescue her, Murdoc is forced to seek MacGyver's help. In this episode, it is revealed that he is terrified of snakes. He has over-the-top disguises and weapons complemented by a maniacal-smile persona that offer a touch of comic relief to the series. One signature giveaway is his wearing a death's head ring. He gets childlike joy from taunting his victims before he kills them using elaborate traps (which MacGyver can just manage to escape). <onlyinclude></onlyinclude> <onlyinclude></onlyinclude> Murdoc is played by David Dastmalchian. As with the original series Murdoc is Angus MacGyver's frequent opponent who never fails – except when MacGyver gets involved, a master of disguise, creative and highly skilled in the use of booby traps, and fond of weapons. However, in this series he is initially a lone master assassin who later attempts to build a "Collective" recruiting other highly skilled assassins towards this goal. Nothing is initially known about Murdoc's childhood, but he later states that as a child he would rip the legs off spiders and then squish them for fun. He also claims his father was abusive and that he killed him. When Murdoc was in his early 20s he failed the psychiatric tests when attempting to enlist in the army, and started working within foreign militaries in order to fulfill his desire to shoot and kill people. Eventually he was mentored by an assassin named Nicolas Helman, who Murdoc tells MacGyver and Jack Dalton he considers a worse adversary and more deadly individual than himself. They end their partnership and later Murdoc accidentally killed Helman's wife during a shootout between them. After becoming an assassin, but over a decade before his first encounter with MacGyver, Murdoc met a woman named Nadia who became pregnant with his child and fell in love with him while he only felt she was "less repulsive than most humans". Soon after giving birth to their child, Murdoc smothered her to death using a pillow, revealing she was his intended target all along. MacGyver's first known encounter with Murdoc is when Murdoc was hired to assassinate MacGyver by an initially unknown individual. He is then known as the international assassin Suspect 218, until he is formally introduced in his meeting of MacGyver's roommate Wilt Bozer and later to MacGyver himself. Murdoc is able to deceive Bozer long enough to enter MacGyver's home by pretending to be a "friend from work" there to see him. During a phone call MacGyver warns Bozer about Murdoc and his likely true intentions to kill him until Murdoc forces Bozer to end the call. Murdoc then subdues Bozer and uses one of Bozer's movie masks to hide his appearance when Macgyver returns. Murdoc is able to get the rest of MacGyver's Phoenix Team as hostages and demands that MacGyver surrender to him or he would kill the team. After a final showdown between the two, Murdoc loses and is arrested by the Phoenix Foundation. At this time he refuses to reveal any other identity, and states he is Murdoc; this is actually the name of a previous victim, but the only name he will give them. Murdoc's next appearance is later that year; Riley Davis and Bozer visit him in prison to determine the identity of the mole within the Phoenix Foundation. Murdoc states he will not give them any information until they get him a rare first edition book. They do and Murdoc assists them by giving them all the information he has. Murdoc later helps Macgyver to impersonate him in order to find an individual being targeted and the person requesting the assassination. During the course of this event it is revealed that the leader of Phoenix, Matilda Webber, had found out about his now teenage son, Cassian, who attends an exclusive private school in Switzerland. It is further revealed that while Murdoc does care for Cassian, sending him presents and keeping him safe, Cassian is unaware of his father's career as an assassin. At the end of the first season it is discovered that Murdoc was able to secretly hire an assassin to enter the Phoenix Foundation headquarters in disguise to get revenge on Macgyver and team. While the entire team does survive the hired assassin, Murdoc is able to kill his prison guard and escape prison. During their next encounter Murdoc drugs and kidnaps MacGyver, holding him in an abandoned warehouse basement and demanding to know Cassian's location. While MacGyver argues that Cassian would dislike him for what he has done, Murdoc responds saying "boys need their fathers" and uses MaGyver's recent searching for his father as proof. However, MacGyver refuses to disclose his location and eventually Murdoc leaves the room giving MacGyver an opportunity to escape through sewer tunnels. When the Phoenix Foundation agents arrive they find a picture of a man named Henry Fletcher and assume he is a new target. While the team is at the warehouse, Murdoc calls Samantha Cage on the phone and after a brief conversation about their similarities, including the use of false names (something her team seems unaware of), he shoots Cage with a sniper rifle. It is soon discovered that Cage was wearing a bulletproof vest and survives. The team then determines that Fletcher is a professor who also is employed covertly as an assassin who makes his victims disappear. After arresting Fletcher, Murdoc frees Fletcher from a transport vehicle by using a rocket launcher, and leaves MacGyver trapped in the wreckage. After Murdoc rescues Fletcher, he requests that he be his first recruit into his "collective" of assassins. After finding out Cage survived his earlier attempt to kill her, Murdoc makes a second attempt. This time he shot her at close range and left her to die alone. However, she was able to call MacGyver, who got her to a hospital where she recovered. Later Henry Fletcher requests and succeeds in receiving $10 million to hand Murdoc over to the Phoenix Foundation. After trading, Helman shows back up seeking revenge for killing his wife and reveals that Murdoc's real first name is Dennis. Murdoc is able to get away while they are hiding and during a moment when MacGyver is left alone by Dalton, both Murdoc and Helman reappear and Murdoc shoots MacGyver in the shoulder to get him out of the way and then kills Helman. He then surrenders and requests to see his son in return for saving MacGyver’s life. When he sees Cassian he asks him to put on an earlier present he sent him, headphones, and turn up his favorite song as loud as he wants. While his son is distracted he kills the guards using a pencil sharpener blade and flees with his son. He then drives to Fletcher’s apartment and kills him after implying his plan is to kill all those members of his Collective that betrayed him. The original Murdoc, Michael Des Barres, portrayed Murdoc's mentor, Nicolas Helman, in the 2016 series. </doc> <doc id="2340788" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340788" title="Cavallo"> Cavallo Cavallo may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2340790" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340790" title="Russel"> Russel Russel is an alternate spelling of Russell.

By his collection of flints Boucher de Perthes had been the first to attempt to establish the existence of man in remote ages; but it had been objected that if the flints were indeed the work of man, human remains would have been found in association with them. Considerable excitement therefore was created both in England and France by the "find" of bones at Moulin Quignon, and a commission of inquiry was appointed. The report was favourable to the genuineness of the relics, but latterly doubts have arisen as to whether they can be regarded as earlier than the Neolithic age. </doc> <doc id="2340811" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340811" title="Oksywie culture"> Oksywie culture The Oksywie culture (ger. Oxhöft-Kultur) was an archaeological culture that existed in the area of modern-day Eastern Pomerania around the lower Vistula river from the 2nd century BC to the early 1st century AD. It is named after the village of Oksywie, now part of the city of Gdynia in northern Poland, where the first archaeological finds typical of this culture were discovered. Archaeological research during the past recent decades near Pomerania in Poland suggests that the transition of the local component of the Pomeranian culture into the Oksywie culture occurred in the 2nd century BC. A connection with the Rugii has been suggested. Like other cultures of this period, the Oksywie culture related to La Tène cultural characteristics, and possessed traits typically shown from the Baltic cultures. Oksywie culture's ceramics and burial customs indicate strong ties with the Przeworsk culture. Men only had their ashes placed in well made black urns with fine finish and a decorative band around. Their graves were supplied with practical items for the afterlife such as utensils and weapons. Typically buried with the man, this culture would also place swords with one-sided edge, and the graves were often covered or marked by stones. Women's ashes were buried in hollows and supplied with feminine items. </doc> <doc id="2340815" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340815" title="Frank Windsor"> Frank Windsor Frank Windsor (born Frank W.

Punch Records was founded in the Perry Barr area of Birmingham in 1997 by Ammo Talwar MBE. The organisation began as an urban music record store, and a place where underground DJs from the West Midlands could demonstrate and grow their mixing and rapping abilities. Following on from the success of these extra activities, Punch began to host development events for young people as part of what would grow into Punch's famed outreach programme, used by local schools. From this, Birmingham City Council became involved and now regularly programme events through Punch which have included a roadshow in Centenary Square during Birmingham's European Capital of Culture 2008 bid. In 2002, the success of the record shop led Ammo to relocate to Birmingham's Creative Quarter, the Custard Factory complex in Digbeth where the company now runs rhythm, song writing, music production, poetry, lyrics, dance, street art, photography and percussion lessons for the local community, schools and youth centres. In 2003, Punch produced a film called "Preskool", highlighting and promoting Birmingham's black music scene Punch now collaborates with companies such as Artfest, the BBC, BMG, OOM Gallery, Sony, Urban Music Seminar and Warners.

In the character's final "Z Cars" appearance "Distance" (Series 9, Episode 28), Skinner was gunned down in the line of duty. The death of any policeman in real life or fiction was still uncommon in the 1970s and this moment became one of TV's biggest dramatic shocks of the decade. It was not the first time Ian played a character with an untimely ending. Ian's character Angus Hart was the original lead of the Channel 5 soap opera "Family Affairs", appearing in over 400 episodes. Angus Hart was killed in a shock storyline when the entire Hart family were killed in a boat explosion.

Stagecoach in Lincolnshire is the trading name of the Lincolnshire RoadCar Company Limited, which is a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group, and part of its East Midlands division. The Lincolnshire Road Car Company was formed in 1928. Under the Transport Act 1968 it became part of the National Bus Company. Lincolnshire RoadCar ran services from throughout the county of Lincolnshire including some services over the county boundaries to such towns as Newark-on-Trent. Many rural services ran from Lincoln St. Marks Bus Station to the outlying villages surrounding the city. Although these services ran within the city boundary, passengers were not allowed to use them for internal journeys within the city. Bus services within the city of Lincoln were provided by Lincoln City (Corporation) Transport. Lincolnshire RoadCar not only provided long distance services within the county but also town services within many towns in the county, such as Louth and Sleaford, When the Transport Act 1985 deregulated bus services, the National Bus Company was broken up and RoadCar was acquired by the Yorkshire Traction Group in 1988. Upon deregulation passengers were also permitted to use RoadCar services for journeys wholly within the city of Lincoln and RoadCar and city buses started competing on many routes in Lincoln and around the surrounding villages, the city buses leaving the confines of the city for rural routes for the first time. Lincolnshire RoadCar/Yorkshire Traction took over Lincoln City Transport in 1993. On 11 April 2004, a Volvo B7TL double-decker bus with East Lancs Vyking bodywork operated by Lincolnshire RoadCar collided with a number of pedestrians outside the main entrance to Fantasy Island amusement park on Sea Lane in Ingoldmells. Five pedestrians were killed and six more injured, two critically, in the accident. Following the accident, RoadCar were found guilty of breaching safety provisions for allowing the driver to operate the vehicle type without proper training and for operating a vehicle with faulty brakes; as a result, they were fined £2,000 at Skegness Magistrates Court on 8 August 2005. The bus driver was found guilty of five counts of causing death by dangerous driving and a single count of driving without due care and attention, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on 9 November 2005. RoadCar became a subsidiary of the Stagecoach Group in December 2005, when that company purchased RoadCar's parent company, Traction Group. The company now trades as Stagecoach in Lincolnshire. From March 2006, Stagecoach purchased new buses for the company, among them four Alexander Dennis Darts and five MAN 18.220/Alexander Dennis ALX300s for the Gainsborough area, in a bid to improve services, gradually phasing out the oldest of RoadCar's buses. The new vehicles temporarily featured RoadCar logos in the front and side windows, and buses from other Stagecoach areas were seen in the area during the transition. The existing fleet then had their RoadCar logos removed. At the beginning of August 2006, Stagecoach caused considerable controversy with their decision to make major changes to the bus network in Lincoln. Some services were withdrawn without replacement while others benefited from frequency increases. Following a local media campaign, the company agreed to make some changes to return services to those areas which had lost them. At the same time, the company also lost a majority of its service work in Nottinghamshire to Veolia Transport's subsidiary Dunn-Line and local company KJB. In Autumn 2007 Stagecoach announced the withdrawal of some services in Louth, Lincoln and Gainsborough. The threatened services survived after successful negotiations with the district councils over subsidies. In August 2008, the company's depot in Louth was closed, with some routes being taken over by Skegness and Grimsby depots and a number of contracted routes surrendered. The company opened their brand new depot in Skegness in September 2009. It is located on Burgh Road and cost £2.2 million.

Fargus was intended for his father's business, but at the age of 13 joined the school ship "Conway" in the Mersey, lent by the Admiralty for training future merchant navy officers. In deference to his father's wishes, however, he gave up the idea of becoming a seaman. He returned to Bristol, where he was articled to a firm of accountants until his father's death in 1868, when he took over the family auctioneering business. He married Amy Spark, daughter of a Bristol alderman, on 26 August 1871. They had three sons and a daughter. One son, Archibald, was a first-class cricketer, scholar and clergyman. While a clerk Fargus had written the words for various songs, adopting the pen name Hugh Conway in memory of his training-ship days. James Williams Arrowsmith, the Bristol printer and publisher, took an interest in his work, and Fargus's first short story appeared in "Arrowsmith's Miscellany". In 1883 Fargus published through J. W. Arrowsmith his first novella, "Called Back", an early thriller of which over 350,000 copies were sold within four years. One admirer was the American poet Emily Dickinson. A stage version of the book was produced in London in 1884, and in that year Fargus published another story, "Dark Days". Ordered to the Riviera for his health, Fargus caught typhoid fever and died in Monte Carlo. He was buried in Nice. Several other books by him appeared posthumously, notably "A Family Affair", which was serialized in the "English Illustrated Magazine" in 1884–85 and first published in volume form in 1885.

He is regarded as one of the most significant organists of his time, and was critically acclaimed for his performances of Johann Sebastian Bach. In 1939, after nearly fifty years in America, Middelschulte returned to Germany, where he died only four years later. His students included Virgil Fox and Cecilia Clare Bocard. Fox frequently used as an encore to his performances Middelschulte's "Perpetuum Mobile", an elaborate piece that builds from a subdued sound to, by the end, fortissimo and played almost entirely on the pedals; the penultimate measure contains an ascending scalar flourish and the last measure a single chord both played on full organ.

He was born in Langon, Gironde and died in Agen. After writing an unpublished paper setting forth his basic concepts in 1862, he worked on developing practical processes for color photography on the three-color principle, using both additive and subtractive methods. In 1868 he patented his ideas and in 1869 he published them in "Les couleurs en photographie, solution du problème". The discovery of dye sensitization by Hermann Wilhelm Vogel in 1873 greatly facilitated the initial three-color analysis on which all of Ducos de Hauron's methods depended. The most widely reproduced of his surviving color photographs is the "View of Agen", an 1877 image of a landscape in southern France, printed by the subtractive assembly method he pioneered. Several different photographs of the view from his attic window, one dated 1874, also survive, as do later views taken in Algeria, still life subjects, reproductions of paintings and art prints, and at least two portraits of uncertain date. In 1891, he introduced the anaglyph stereoscopic print, the "red and blue glasses" type of 3-D print. Although others had earlier applied the same principle to drawings or used it to project images onto a screen, he was the first to reproduce stereoscopic photographs in the convenient form of anaglyph prints on paper. </doc> <doc id="2340890" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340890" title="Blanche Barton"> Blanche Barton Blanche Barton (born Sharon Leigh ; October 1, 1961) is an American religious leader who is Magistra Templi Rex within the Church of Satan, and is addressed by Satanists as "Magistra Barton". Barton was raised in San Diego, a self-proclaimed Phi Beta Kappa and graduate from Redlands College with a degree in journalism and literature. She moved in with church leader Anton LaVey the day after Diane Hegarty, the original high priestess, left the Black House. After LaVey and Hegarty's daughter Zeena LaVey (High Priestess 1985–1990) abdicated her position in 1990, the position was vacant until Barton assumed the role of High Priestess upon Anton LaVey's death on October 29, 1997. On November 7, 1997 LaVey's eldest daughter, Karla LaVey, held a press conference to announce the death of Anton LaVey. It was at this time that Barton and Karla LaVey announced that they would run the Church of Satan as co-High Priestesses. Several days later Barton produced a hand written will claiming that LaVey had left all of his belongings, property, writings, and royalties, including the Church of Satan to be put in a trust, exclusively for Barton's son Satan Xerxes Carnacki LaVey, managed by Barton. Karla contested this will which was later found to be invalid. A settlement was later reached in which Anton LaVey’s belongings, writings, and royalties would be split among his three children, Karla, Zeena and Satan, and that Barton would receive the “corporation known as Church of Satan.” In 1999 Barton led an unsuccessful campaign to raise $400,000 with which to repurchase the Black House, where many of the church's notorious rites were performed. Barton remained High Priestess until April 30, 2002, when she appointed Peggy Nadramia as High Priestess and assumed Nadramia's previous role of chairmistress of the Council of Nine. Barton wrote "The Church of Satan: A History of the World's Most Notorious Religion" (1990) and "The Secret Life of a Satanist: The Authorized Biography of Anton LaVey" (1990). </doc> <doc id="2340895" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340895" title="Massey Energy"> Massey Energy Massey Energy Company was a coal extractor in the United States with substantial operations in West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia. By revenue, it was the fourth largest producer of coal in the United States and the largest coal producer in Central Appalachia. By coal production weight, it was the sixth largest producer of coal in the United States. Massey's mines yielded around 40 million tons annually. The company controlled 2.3 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves in Southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Southwest Virginia and Tennessee or about a third of all Central Appalachian reserves. It employed approximately 5,850 people and operated 35 underground mines and 12 surface mines. Massey Energy owned and operated Upper Big Branch Mine where 29 miners were killed in April 2010. The Mine Safety and Health Administration found that the company's culture of favoring production over safety contributed to flagrant safety violations that caused the coal dust explosion. It assessed $10.8 million in fines for 369 citations and orders, the largest for any mine disaster in U.S. history. Alpha Natural Resources additionally settled Massey's potential criminal liabilities for $209 million. In January 2011, it was announced that Massey Energy company would be bought by competitor Alpha Natural Resources for $7.1 billion. More than 99% of Massey shareholders and 98% of Alpha shareholders voted in favor of the acquisition and courts in Delaware and West Virginia agreed with the shareholders' vote. A.T. Massey incorporated the A.T. Massey Coal Company in 1920 as a coal brokering business in Richmond, Virginia, and served as the company’s first president. A.T. Massey acquired its first mining operation in 1945 and expanded its business to include coal mining and processing. Five generations of the Massey family headed the company, including Evan Massey in 1945, William E. Massey in 1962 and E. Morgan Massey in 1972. St. Joe Minerals acquired controlling interest in A.T. Massey in 1974. Six years later, St. Joe Minerals sold a part-interest in A. T. Massey to Royal Dutch Shell, forming the Massey Coal Partnership to run the company. In 1981, the Fluor Corporation acquired St. Joe Minerals. In 1984, the United Mine Workers of America went on strike against A.T. Massey, sparking a series of confrontations documented in the film "Mine War on Blackberry Creek". Fluor bought Royal Dutch Shell's interest in the Massey Coal Partnership in 1987 and changed its name back to A. T. Massey Coal Company, initiating a period of significant growth through acquisitions. In 1992 Don Blankenship was appointed President, Chairman and CEO of A.T. Massey Coal Company; he served as the Chairman and CEO of Massey for 18 years. Blankenship oversaw continued company growth, including several more acquisitions and the establishment of several subsidiaries. A.T. Massey completed a reverse spin-off from Fluor Corporation in 2000 and was renamed Massey Energy Company. As of 2010, Massey Energy produced, processed, and sold bituminous coal of steam and metallurgical grades, primarily of low sulfur content, through its 22 processing and shipping centers, called "resource groups," many of which received coal from multiple coal mines. Massey currently operates 35 underground mines and 12 surface mines in West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia. In 2007, Massey announced a strategic alliance with Essar Mineral Resources Ltd., a member of Essar Group of India, to jointly evaluate and develop select business opportunities on a project-by-project basis. The company recently promoted several executives to new positions. In November 2008, Massey promoted Baxter Phillips Jr., formerly executive vice president and chief administrative officer, to president, a position previously held by Massey Chairman and CEO Don Blankenship. Phillips’ new position will focus on Massey Energy's strategic growth plans and will continue to manage sales, finance, human resources, information systems and investor relations at the company's Richmond headquarters. In January 2009, the company promoted John M. Poma to vice president and chief administrative officer, Jeffrey M. Gillenwater to vice president of human resources and Steve Sears to vice president of sales and marketing, nearly a year after promoting Shane Harvey to general counsel. On Dec. 31, 2010, longtime CEO Don Blankenship stepped down, and was replaced as CEO by Massey President Baxter F. Phillips Jr. On June 1, 2011, shareholders of Alpha Natural Resources agreed to buy Massey Energy for $7.1 billion, making it the nation's largest metallurgical coal company. Some shareholder groups had tried to block the sale claiming that Massey managers had engineered the sale of the company to protect themselves from liabilities and had arranged new management jobs with Alpha. In response to a prolonged citizen campaign on the environment, on May 29, 2009 Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee announced his resignation from the Board of Massey Energy. Gee had said he believed he could do more environmental good on the board than off it. There are 23 coal mining sites run by Massey Energy. There are sixteen sites located in West Virginia, five in Kentucky, and one in Virginia. Locations in West Virginia: Delbarton, Elk Run, Greun Valley, Guyandotte, Independence, Logan, County, Mammoth, Marfork, Nicholas Energy, Progress Energy, Rawl, Republic Energy, and Stirrat. Locations in Kentucky: Long Fork, Martin County, New Ridge, and Sidney. Locations in Virginia: Knox Creek. In January 2008, the company agreed to a $20 million settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to resolve thousands of violations of the Clean Water Act for routinely polluting waterways in Kentucky and West Virginia with coal slurry and wastewater. Although this was the largest Clean Water Act settlement, the violations were estimated to have fines on the order of $2.4 billion. In October 2000, a coal slurry impoundment owned by Martin County Coal Company, a Massey Energy subsidiary in Martin County, Kentucky, suddenly breached and released over 200 million gallons of coal slurry into two mountain streams, Coldwater Creek and Wolf Creek. The Martin County coal slurry spill was called the worst ever environmental disaster in the southeastern United States by the EPA. The spill smothered all aquatic life in the streams and left residents with contaminated drinking water. Cleanup costs for the spill were approximately $50 million. On January 19, 2006 a belt line fire killed miners Don I. Bragg, 33, and Ellery Elvis Hatfield, 47, at Massey's Aracoma Alma Number 1 Mine in Logan County, West Virginia. Efforts to fight the fire were hampered by inadequate fire extinguishers, fire hose couplings which did not match the water line, and a lack of water in the lines. On December 22, 2008 Massey Energy agreed to pay $4.2 million in civil and criminal penalties for the accident. It is the largest financial settlement in the coal industry's history. The Charleston (WV) Gazette reported on January 15, 2009 that Aracoma widows Delorice Bragg and Freda Hatfield urged U.S. District Judge John T. Copenhaver to reject Massey's plea bargain and fine for the accident. Widow Bragg stated that it was clear "that Massey executives expected the Alma Mine to emphasize production over the safety of the coal miners inside." On February 1, 2006, bulldozer operator Paul K. Moss, 58, of Sissonville, West Virginia died when his machine ruptured a natural gas line at Elk Run Coal Co.'s Black Castle surface mine. The bulldozer was immediately engulfed in flames. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration report, operator Moss exited the cab but his body was found behind the blade. Massey Energy was fined $2.5 million after a federal judge accepted the company's guilty plea to 10 criminal charges for the fire. A U.S. District approved a plea deal despite a provision sparing Massey officials and the Richmond, Va., coal company from prosecution. The agreement also required Aracoma to pay a $1.7 million fine for civil violations found by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. On October 8, 2008 Steven Cain, 32, of Comfort, West Virginia was killed at Massey Energy's Independence Coal Justice No. 1 Mine when he was crushed by a railcar. A Mine Safety and Health Administration report concludes Cain was killed because Massey managers assigned him a dangerous job, although he had “little mining experience and minimal training.” In 2009, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration cited Massey Energy's Upper Big Branch coal mine for 495 violations and proposed $911,802 in fines. On April 5, 2010, an explosion at Massey owned Performance Coal Co. mine in Montcoal, West Virginia resulted in the deaths of 29 miners. The explosion, which has become known as the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, is the worst mining disaster in 40 years, with a greater loss of life than in any mining accident since the 1970s. The federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) released its final report on December 6, 2011, concluding that flagrant safety violations contributed to a coal dust explosion. It issued 369 citations at that time, assessing $10.8 million in penalties. Investigators also noted the historical record of safety violations at the Upper Big Branch mine, which amassed more than 1,100 violations in the past three years, many of them serious, including 50 of them in March 2010 for violations including improper ventilation of methane and poor escape routes. Federal regulators had ordered portions of the mine closed 60 times over the year preceding the explosion. It was claimed, that the FBI had launched a probe investigating the possible bribery of federal officials overseeing mining industry regulation by Massey Energy. In June 2009, a Raleigh County judge granted a preliminary injunction to block anti-mountaintop removal activists from further protests on some Massey Energy sites. In 1998, Hugh Caperton filed a lawsuit against A.T. Massey Coal Company alleging that Massey fraudulently canceled a coal supply contract with Harman Mining, resulting in its going out of business. In 2007, when the case came before the West Virginia Supreme Court, Caperton petitioned for Justice Benjamin to recuse himself. Benjamin declined and was ultimately part of the 3 to 2 majority that overturned the jury's $50 million verdict. In November 2008, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal. Wal-Mart, PepsiCo, Intel Corporation, Lockheed Martin, Common Cause and Public Citizen filed briefs in the case urging the United States Supreme Court to reject the West Virginia Supreme Court's decision. The briefs contended that Justice Brent Benjamin was biased in the case. On June 8, 2009, The US Supreme Court agreed 5-4, sending the case back to the West Virginia Supreme Court, and forcing Justice Benjamin to recuse himself from the case. The New York Times opined that the case involved "egregious ethical myopia" on the part of Justice Benjamin. In February 2003 a judge ordered Massey to pay the residents of Sylvester, West Virginia $473,000 to settle complaints that coal dust from Massey's Elk Run Processing Plant had caused health problems and lowered property values in the nearby town. In addition the payment to the residents of Sylvester, Massey Energy was ordered to construct a cloth dome over their coal processing plant to reduce the dust. On September 16, 2004, a civil jury ordered Massey to pay $1.54 million in damages to 245 residents of Mingo County, W. Va., who lost their water wells after Massey had mined beneath the homes. The jury concluded that Massey acted “with malicious, willful, wanton, reckless or intentional disregard for plaintiffs’ rights.” In 2005, Wheeling, W.Va.-based steelmaker Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel sued Virginia-based Massey Energy claiming Massey failed to deliver on a contract of 104,000 tons of coal monthly. In July 2007, a Circuit Court in Brooke County, W.Va. upheld the jury award of more than $267 million, including accrued interest. Massey appealed the case to the US Supreme Court, which declined to hear the appeal in December 2008. In 2005, some residents of Raleigh County, West Virginia, complained that Massey's Goals Coal Company was endangering the health and well-being of students at the adjacent Marsh Fork Elementary School. In July 2005, the West Virginia Division of Environmental Protection revoked a permit for construction of a coal silo near the school. However, some local employees and residents supported Massey Energy by arguing that the economic benefits received from the company outweigh the environmental impact to the area. 30 non-violent protestors were arrested, including actress Daryl Hannah, NASA climatologist James E. Hansen, and former West Virginia Congressman Ken Hechler. In June 2009, the West Virginia Supreme Court concluded that the Massey was allowed to build their second silo; "We therefore find that the circuit court did not err, and properly affirmed the decision of the West Virginia Surface Mine Board." In December 2008 residents of Prenter, West Virginia filed a lawsuit claiming that underground slurry injection from a Massey coal facility, and other coal preparation plants, contaminated their underground water supply. On June 12, 2012 a confidential settlement was reached between Massey Energy and the residents of Prenter, West Virginia. On Oct 30, 2009, Fayette County West Virginia Judge Paul Blake ruled in an age discrimination lawsuit that more than 200 miners who were not rehired after Massey Energy Co. bought a bankrupt West Virginia mine were entitled to a settlement of $8.75 million. The suit covers 229 miners, including 82 union miners. Massey has been ordered to rehire the miners. Under the terms of the settlement, the 82 union miners will each receive $38,000. The remaining miners will receive $19,000. Among Massey Energy’s contributions to the community are an annual Christmas Extravaganza for local children, financial assistance to local schools, and $1 million in college and post-graduate scholarships. Massey co-sponsors the Appalachian Leadership and Education Foundation (ALEF) and in 1997 formed "Doctors for our Communities" with Marshall University, providing MD student loans that are waived if the recipient practices medicine for a minimum of seven years in Massey’s operating region. The Massey Cancer Center of Virginia Commonwealth University is named in honor of William E. Massey for his financial endowment. In 2005 Massey established the "Family Wellness Center" that offers medical services to employees' families in McDowell and Logan county in West Virginia, who often lack access to primary care physicians and health care facilities. A Harvard study found that these counties' life expectancies average among the 25 worst in the United States. </doc> <doc id="2340902" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340902" title="Municipalities of Germany"> Municipalities of Germany Municipalities (, singular ) are the lowest level of official territorial division in Germany. This is most commonly the third level of territorial division, ranking after the "Land" (state) and "Kreis" (district). The "Gemeinde" which is one level lower in those states also includes "Regierungsbezirke" (singular: "Regierungsbezirk") as an intermediate territorial division. The "Gemeinde" is one level higher if it is not part of a "Samtgemeinde". Only 10 municipalities in Germany have fifth level administrative subdivisions and all of them are in Bavaria. The highest degree of autonomy may be found in the "Gemeinden" which are not part of a "Kreis". These "Gemeinden" are referred to as "Kreisfreie Städte" or "Stadtkreise", sometimes translated as having "city status". This can be the case even for small municipalities. However, many smaller municipalities have lost this city status in various administrative reforms in the last 40 years when they were incorporated into a "Kreis". In some states they retained a higher measure of autonomy than the other municipalities of the "Kreis" (e.g. "Große Kreisstadt"). Municipalities titled "Stadt" (town or city) are urban municipalities while those titled "Gemeinde" are classified as rural municipalities. With more than 3,400,000 inhabitants, the most populated municipality of Germany is the city of Berlin; and the least populated is Gröde in Schleswig-Holstein. The cities of Aachen and Saarbrücken have a special status, which is why the numbers in the respective states North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland appear in brackets in the table.

They formed a partnership that "is possibly unique in literary history. Not only did they write all their books together, they did not spend more than a day apart in their adult lives, until they were finally parted by Jules's death in 1870." They are known for their literary work and for their diaries, which offer an intimate view into the French literary society of the later 19th century. Their career as writers began with an account of a sketching holiday together. They then published books on aspects of 18th-century French and Japanese art and society. Their histories ("Portraits intimes du XVIIIe siècle" (1857), "La Femme au XVIIIe siècle" (1862), "La du Barry" (1878), and others) are made entirely out of documents, autograph letters, scraps of costume, engravings, songs, the unconscious self-revelations of the time. In their volumes (e.g., "Portraits intimes du XVIII siecle"), they dismissed the vulgarity of the Second Empire in favour of a more refined age. They wrote the long "Journal des Goncourt" from 1851, which gives a view of the literary and social life of their time. When they came to write novels, it was with a similar attempt to give the inner, undiscovered, minute truths of contemporary existence. They published six novels, of which "Germinie Lacerteux", 1865, was the fourth. It is based on the true case of their own maidservant, Rose Malingre, whose double life they had never suspected. After the death of Jules, Edmond continued to write novels in the same style. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition: They are buried together (in the same grave) in Montmartre Cemetery. Edmond de Goncourt bequeathed his entire estate for the foundation and maintenance of the Académie Goncourt. Since 1903, the académie has awarded the Prix Goncourt, probably the most important literary prize in French literature. The first English translation of "Manette Salomon", translated by Tina Kover, was published in November 2017 by Snuggly Books.

She was born in Ferrara to Fulvio Pellegrino Morato and a certain Lucrezia (possibly Gozi). Her father, who had been tutor to the young princes of the ducal house of Este, was on intimate terms with the most learned men of Italy, and the daughter grew up in an atmosphere of classical learning. At the age of twelve she was able to converse fluently in Greek and Latin. About this time she was summoned to the palace as companion and instructor of the younger but equally gifted Anna d'Este, daughter of Renata, duchess of Ferrara. Many people with literary fame or Protestant leanings, like John Calvin, Vittoria Colonna and Clément Marot visited the court of the duchess. In her teens Olympia lectured on Cicero and Calvin's works. In 1546 she left court to take care of her ailing father and, after his death, she took care of the education of her brothers and sisters. Olympia's father died a convert to Protestantism, and Olympia embraced the doctrines of Luther and Calvin. When she returned to court, Anna d'Este's marriage to Francis, Duke of Guise left Olympia isolated. She spent her time studying philosophy and corresponded with Gasparo Sardi, who dedicated his "De Triplici Philosophia" to her. About the end of 1550, she married a young student of medicine and philosophy, Andreas Grundler of Schweinfurt in Bavaria. In 1554 she accompanied Grundler to his place of birth, where he had been appointed physician to the garrison of Spanish troops. In 1553 the margrave Albert of Brandenburg on one of his plundering expeditions took possession of Schweinfurt, and was in turn besieged by the Protestants. At length Albert evacuated the place, and Olympia and her husband made their escape. In the course of these events many of her writings were lost. They finally succeeded in reaching Heidelberg in 1554 where a medical lectureship had been obtained for Grundler through the influence of the Erbach family, by whom they had been hospitably entertained during their flight. In 1558, after her death, a major collection of some of her Greek letters and Latin dialogues was published in Basel, a labour which she entrusted to her friend and correspondent Caelius Secundus Curio. </doc> <doc id="2340945" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340945" title="Ariobarzanes of Phrygia"> Ariobarzanes of Phrygia Ariobarzanes (in Greek Ἀριoβαρζάνης), (Old Persian: Ariyabrdhna, "Ariyaubrdhna") "Ariobarzan" or spelled as Ario Barzan or Aryo Barzan, perhaps signifying ""exalting the Aryans"" (death: crucified in c. 362 BCE), sometimes known as Ariobarzanes I of Cius, was a Persian Satrap of Phrygia and military commander, leader of an independence revolt, and the first known of the line of rulers of the Greek town of Cius from which were eventually to stem the kings of Pontus in the 3rd century BCE. Ariobarzanes was apparently a cadet member of the Achaimenid dynasty, specifically its branch which had settled to hold Dascylium of Hellespont in the 470s BCE. Cius is located near Dascylium, and Cius seemingly was a share of family holdings for the branch of Ariobarzanes. Ariobarzanes' one predecessor was a (kinsman) named Mithradates (possibly Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia). The archaeologist Walther Judeich claims that Ariobarzanes was that Mithradates' son, but Brian C. McGing refutes that specific filiation. Seemingly, no classical source itself calls them son and father, the filiation being a later reconstruction on basis of successorship. Pharnabazus, Satrap of Phrygia (fl. 413373 BCE), son of Pharnaces of Phrygia, is indicated to have shared his rule and territories with his brothers in the late 5th century BCE when Pharnabazos had recently succeeded to the position. Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia, might have been one of such brothers. Ariobarzanes of Cius might have also been one of those brothers. The classical source Appianus relates that Ariobarzanes was of a cadet line of the family of the Persian Great King Dareios (Darius the Great). It is highly probable he is the same Ariobarzanes who, around 407 BCE, was the Persian envoy to the Greek city-states and cultivated the friendship of Athens and Sparta. Ariobarzanes conducted the Athenian ambassadors, in 405 BCE, to his sea-town of Cius in Mysia, after they had been detained three years by order of Cyrus the Younger. Ariobarzanes was mentioned as under-satrap in Anatolia in late 5th century BCE. He then apparently succeeded his presumed kinsman (possibly elder brother) Pharnabazus (fl. 413373 BCE) as satrap of Phrygia and Lydia, assigned by Pharnabazos himself when he departed to the Persian court to marry Apama, daughter of the Persian king. Thus Ariobarzanes became the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, in what is now the northwest of Turkey. Pharnabazos lived well into the 370s BCE, having obtained higher positions in the Persian monarchy than merely the Phrygian satrapship. Ariobarzanes assisted Antalcidas in 388 BCE. He appears to have still held some high office in the Persian court in 368 BCE, as we find him, apparently on behalf of the king, sending an embassy to Greece in that year. Ariobarzanes, who is called by Diodorus satrap of Phrygia, and by Nepos satrap of Lydia, Ionia, and Phrygia, revolted against Artaxerxes II in 362. Demosthenes speaks of Ariobarzanes and his three sons having been lately made Athenian citizens. He mentions him again in the following year and says, that the Athenians had sent Timotheus to his assistance; but that when the Athenian general saw that Ariobarzanes was in open revolt against the king, he refused to assist him. When Pharnabazos' son, Artabazos II of Phrygia, wanted to regain his father's satrapy from their kinsman, Ariobarzanes refused. Ultimately, in about 366 BCE, Ariobarzanes joined an unsuccessful revolt of the satraps of western Anatolia against the Achamenian King Artaxerxes II (Revolt of the Satraps). Several other satraps sided with Ariobarzanes, including Mausolus of Caria (briefly), Orontes I of Armenia, Autophradates of Lydia and Datames of Cappadocia. The rebel satraps also received support from the pharaoh of Egypt, Teos, as well as from some of the Greek city states, with the Spartan king Agesilaus II coming to their assistance with a mercenary force. As signal of sympathy in the effort, Athens made Ariobarzanes and three of his sons citizens of Athens. Ariobarzanes was betrayed by his son Mithridates to his overlord, the Persian king, who had Ariobarzanes crucified. </doc> <doc id="2340946" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340946" title="Helene Weigel"> Helene Weigel Helene Weigel (12 May 19006 May 1971) was a distinguished German actress and artistic director. She was the second wife of Bertolt Brecht and was married to him from 1930 until his death in 1956. Together they had two children. Weigel was born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, the daughter of Leopoldine (née Pollak) and Siegfried Weigel, an accountant-general in a textile factory. Her family was Jewish. She and husband Brecht had two children, Stefan Brecht and Barbara Brecht-Schall. Weigel was a Communist Party member from 1930. Weigel became the artistic director of the Berliner Ensemble after Brecht's death in 1956. She is most noted for creating several Brecht roles, including: Pelagea Vlassova, "The Mother" of 1932; "Antigone" in Brecht's version of the Greek tragedy; the title role in his civil war play, "Señora Carrar's Rifles"; and the iconic Mother Courage. Between 1933 and 1947, as a refugee from Adolf Hitler's Germany, she was seldom able to pursue her acting craft, even during the family's six-year stay in Los Angeles. It was only with the foundation of the Berliner Ensemble in the East Germany in 1949 that Brecht's theatre began to be recognised worldwide. She died in 1971, still at the helm of the company, and many of the roles that she created with Brecht are still in the theatre's repertoire today. Weigel died in East Berlin on 6 May 1971, six days before her 71st birthday. </doc> <doc id="2340948" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340948" title="Ling Zhen"> Ling Zhen Ling Zhen is a fictional character in "Water Margin", one of the Four Great Classical Novels in Chinese literature. Nicknamed "Heaven Shaking Thunder", he ranks 52nd among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 16th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Ling Zhen is from Yanling (燕陵; believed to be present-day Yanling County, Henan). He not only excels in archery and military skills, but also has extensive expertise in pyrotechnics and firearms. He is so skilled in firing cannons that he is known as the top artilleryman in China in his time. He serves as an artillery officer in Dongjing, the imperial capital of the Song dynasty. Emperor Huizong orders Huyan Zhuo, Han Tao and Peng Qi to lead government forces to attack the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh. Although Peng Qi defects to Liangshan after being captured by the outlaws, Huyan Zhuo does not feel demoralised and continues to gain the upper hand with his seemingly impregnable chain-linked armoured cavalry formation. When the outlaws retreat back to their stronghold and use the surrounding marshes as a buffer, Huyan Zhuo writes to Dongjing to ask the imperial court to send Ling Zhen to assist him. Ling Zhen brings along his arsenal of firearms and long-range artillery, and throws the outlaws into panic and disarray with his heavy bombardment. Wu Yong, Liangshan's chief strategist, orders the Liangshan flotilla to infiltrate Ling Zhen's base at night, sabotage the artillery platform, and lure him to pursue them. Ling Zhen falls for the ruse and runs after the retreating saboteurs deep into the marshes, where his boat is capsized by swimmers hiding underwater. He is captured and brought before Song Jiang, who treats him respectfully and convinces him to join the Liangshan cause. Ling Zhen later helps the Liangshan outlaws defeat the government forces and get Huyan Zhuo to surrender and join Liangshan as well. Ling Zhen is put in charge of pyrotechnics after the 108 Stars of Destiny come together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He follows the Liangshan heroes on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory after they received amnesty from Emperor Huizong. During the campaign against Fang La's rebel forces, Ling Zhen is often called upon to bombard enemy cities with artillery fire to creates chaos. The Liangshan heroes then attack and occupy the cities. Ling Zhen is one of the few lucky survivors after the calamitous campaign against Fang La. He returns to the capital and is offered an official post by the emperor.

The town is located approximately west of Albury on the intersection of the Newell Highway and Riverina Highways. The first permanent residence in the town was built in 1878. The post office opened on 1 January 1881 but was known as Murray Hut until 1893. Europeans first settled the area around Finley in the early 1840s, with wheat becoming the main crop. The Finley Agricultural & Pastoral Association was formed in 1912 and held its first show on 17 September 1913. The agricultural show is still held annually on the first Sunday in September (Father's Day). Periods of severe drought, combined with the Great Depression of the early 1930s, forced many farmers to abandon their holdings. In 1935, construction on the Mulwala Canal began in order to provide employment and bring water to the area’s rich farmland, with irrigation reaching the area in 1939, celebrated with a 'Back-To-Finley' event. This enabled the region to prosper with beef and dairy cattle, sheep, wheat, rice, barley, maize and canola. Finley has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: Finley has two primary schools, St Joseph's School, (Roman Catholic) and Finley Public School. Finley High School attracts students from a wide catchment including the towns of Berrigan, Tocumwal, Jerilderie and Blighty. Finley is also home to a campus of Riverina TAFE. Australian rules football, cricket and netball are all very popular in the town. Sporting teams include the Finley Football Club, who compete in the Murray Football League. The town also offers soccer, touch rugby, basketball, tennis and a Pony Club. The Finley Rodeo Committee holds an annual rodeo every January and Finley Apex Club hosts a tractor pull every February. Finley has an 18-hole green grass golf course and two bowling green locations. </doc> <doc id="2340983" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340983" title="Huang Xin"> Huang Xin Huang Xin is a fictional character in "Water Margin", one of the Four Great Classical Novels in Chinese literature. Nicknamed "Guardian of the Three Mountains", he ranks 38th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 2nd among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Huang Xin is a military officer from Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong). A highly skilled warrior, he specialises in swordsmanship and his weapon of choice is a sword called "Sword of Death" (喪門劍). He earns himself the nickname "Guardian of the Three Mountains" after he once boasted that he can defeat the outlaws based on three mountains in the Qingzhou region: Mount Qingfeng (清風山), Mount Twin Dragons (二龍山) and Mount Peach Blossom (桃花山). When Song Jiang is wrongfully imprisoned by Liu Gao, the official in charge of Qingfeng Fort (清風寨; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong), his friend Hua Rong, who serves as a military officer in the fort, goes to the prison and frees him by force. After Liu Gao reports the incident to the Qingzhou regional government, Murong Yanda, the governor of Qingzhou, orders Huang Xin to lead troops to Qingfeng Fort to assist Liu Gao in dealing with Hua Rong. Huang Xin believes Liu Gao's account, pretends to offer to help Liu Gao and Hua Rong mediate their conflict, and invites Hua Rong to a meeting. When Hua Rong shows up, Huang Xin and his troops ambush him and capture him. They also capture Song Jiang. While escorting Song Jiang and Hua Rong back to Qingzhou, Huang Xin and his troops come under attack by the Mount Qingfeng outlaws, who are friends of Song Jiang. Huang Xin fights the three outlaw chiefs – Yan Shun, Wang Ying and Zheng Tianshou – and manages to hold them off until he sees that he is outnumbered, and decides to retreat to Qingfeng Fort. Upon learning of Huang Xin's defeat, Murong Yanda orders Qin Ming to lead more troops to Qingfeng Fort to reinforce Huang Xin and eliminate the outlaws. However, Qin Ming ends up being captured by the outlaws, and has no choice but to join them after they impersonate him and trick Murong Yanda into believing that he has joined the outlaws. Qin Ming then volunteers to go to Qingfeng Fort to persuade Huang Xin, who has learnt martial arts from him before, to surrender and join them as well. Convinced by Qin Ming's words, Huang Xin opens the fort gates and allows the outlaws to enter and kill Liu Gao and his family in revenge. After the battle, Huang Xin follows the outlaws to Liangshan Marsh, where they join the larger outlaw band there. Huang Xin becomes one of the scouting generals of the Liangshan cavalry after 108 Stars of Destiny come together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He follows the Liangshan heroes on their campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces on Song territory after they received amnesty from Emperor Huizong. Huang Xin is one of the few Liangshan heroes who survive the final campaign against Fang La's rebel forces that took the lives of about two-thirds of the 108 Stars of Destiny. To honour Huang Xin for his service to the Song Empire during the campaigns, Emperor Huizong reinstates him as a military officer in Qingzhou. Huang Xin gladly accepts his appointment and returns to Qingzhou. </doc> <doc id="2340984" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2340984" title="List of Arsenal F.C. records and statistics"> List of Arsenal F.C. records and statistics Arsenal Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Islington, London. The club was formed in Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893. In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier. After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893. In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division at the expense of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight. The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which they were an inaugural member. The list encompasses the honours won by Arsenal at national, regional, county and friendly level, records set by the club, their managers and their players. The player records section itemises the club's leading goalscorers and those who have made most appearances in first-team competitions. It also records notable achievements by Arsenal players on the international stage, and the highest transfer fees paid and received by the club. Attendance records at Highbury, the Emirates Stadium, the club's home ground since 2006, and Wembley Stadium, their temporary home for UEFA Champions League games between 1998 and 1999, are also included. Arsenal have won 13 top-flight titles, and hold the record for the most FA Cup wins, also with 13. The club's record appearance maker is David O'Leary, who made 722 appearances between 1975 and 1993. Thierry Henry is Arsenal's record goalscorer, scoring 228 goals in total. All figures are correct as of the match played on 13 May 2018. Arsenal's first ever silverware was won as the Royal Arsenal in 1890. The Kent Junior Cup, won by Royal Arsenal's reserves, was the club's first trophy, while the first team's first trophy came three weeks later when they won the Kent Senior Cup. Their first national senior honour came in 1930, when they won the FA Cup. The club enjoyed further success in the 1930s, winning another FA Cup and five Football League First Division titles. Arsenal won their first league and cup double in the 1970–71 season and twice repeated the feat, in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as well as winning a cup double of the FA Cup and League Cup in 1992–93. In 2003–04, Arsenal recorded an unbeaten top-flight league season, something achieved only once before by Preston North End in 1888–89, who only had to play 22 games. To mark the achievement, a special gold version of the Premier League trophy was commissioned and presented to the club the following season. Their most recent success came in 2017, when they became the most successful club in FA Cup history with 13 titles. Arsenal's honours and achievements include the following: "Competitive matches only, includes appearances as substitute. Numbers in brackets indicate goals scored." Thierry Henry is the all-time top goalscorer for Arsenal. He passed Ian Wright's eight-year record after scoring twice in a European tie against Sparta Prague in October 2005. Henry was Arsenal's leading goalscorer for seven consecutive seasons, from 1999–2000 to 2005–06. "Competitive matches only. Numbers in brackets indicate appearances made." This section refers only to caps won while an Arsenal player. At 17 years and 75 days, Theo Walcott became the youngest player to earn an England cap, against Hungary on 30 May 2006. For consistency, fees in the record transfer tables below are all sourced from the "London Evening Standard"'s contemporary reports of each transfer. Where the report mentions an initial fee potentially rising to a higher figure depending on contractual clauses being satisfied in the future, only the initial fee is listed in the tables. Arsenal hold several English football records, including the longest unbeaten sequence in the top flight, with 49. Arsenal scored in all 55 league matches from between 19 May 2001 to 30 November 2002 and the club also holds the longest unbeaten away sequence in league football with 27, from 5 April 2003 to 25 September 2004. This section applies to attendances at Highbury, where Arsenal played their home matches from 1913 to 2006, the Emirates Stadium, the club's present home, and Wembley Stadium, which acted as Arsenal's home in the UEFA Champions League during the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons. Arsenal's attendance figures since the move to the Emirates Stadium have been measured by tickets sold. On 17 January 1948, a league-record attendance of 83,260 watched Manchester United play Arsenal at Maine Road. All of the top three attendances in league football occurred at Arsenal games. Arsenal have won two European honours: the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1994. They also reached the final of the UEFA Cup in 2000, and became the first London team to appear in a UEFA Champions League final in 2006. Despite having never won the UEFA Champions League, Arsenal have set numerous records in the competition. Between 1998–99 and the current season, 2016–17, they participated in nineteen successive seasons, a record only surpassed in Europe by Real Madrid. Goalkeeper Jens Lehmann kept ten consecutive clean sheets in the run-in to Arsenal's first UEFA Champions League final and the defence went 995 minutes until conceding a goal. Arsenal were also the first British side to defeat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund away from home, and both Milanese teams: Internazionale and Milan at the San Siro. Thierry Henry holds the club record for most appearances with 86, and is the club's record goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals. In August 1928, Arsenal, alongside Chelsea, made history by becoming the first football clubs to wear numbered shirts. A year earlier the first ever live radio commentary of a football match took place, between Arsenal and Sheffield United. Arsenal played in the first match broadcast live on television, against their reserve counterparts in 1937 and have since participated in the world's first live 3D and interactive football matches, both with Manchester United.

Quintana Roo was one of the most influential men in the Mexican War of Independence and served as a member of the Congress of Chilpancingo. He presided over the Constitutional Assembly, which drafted the Mexican Declaration of Independence in 1813, and he served as a legislator and senator, and Secretary of State, numerous times. Quintana Roo also served as a member of the Mexican Supreme Court and as a member of the "Gobierno tripartito" ("Tripartite Government") (December 23–31, 1829), and edited and managed the "Semanario Patriótico" ("Patriotic Weekly"). The Mexican state of Quintana Roo was named after him. Quintana Roo was born to Don José Matías Quintana and Doña María Ana Roo de Quintana, descendants of Canarian settlers who permanently lived in Yucatán Peninsula. He studied in the "Seminario de San Ildefonso de Mérida" where he proved his great capacity as a writer; in 1808, he continued his studies in Mexico City, at the "Real y Pontificia Universidad de Nueva España" ("Royal and Pontifical University of New Spain"). The elder Quintana established the first printing press and printed the first newspapers on the Yucatán Peninsula. This was troublesome for the viceroys of New Spain, and José Matías Quintana was arrested and jailed. Quintana Roo completed his studies and graduated as a lawyer, joining the law firm of Agustín Pomposo Fernández. There he met and fell in love with Leona Vicario, niece of Don Agustín. Because Don Agustín was a royalist and Quintana Roo favored Mexican independence, he was denied Leona's hand. Despite this, Leona financially supported the cause of independence. She was apprehended in 1813 and locked in the "Colegio de Belén," but managed to escape in disguise, fleeing to Tlalpujahua, where she wed Quintana Roo. In 1802, Pablo Moreno and José María Velázquez founded a group called the "Sanjuanistas" with the goal of suppressing native slavery and ending taxes paid to the Roman Catholic church (the only religious body then allowed in present-day Mexico) and Spanish privileges. Don José Matías Quintana belonged to this group. During the Mexican revolt against Spanish rule, Quintana Roo presided over both the National Constitutional Assembly of 1813–1814, which drafted the failed Constitution of Apatzingán, and the later Constitutional Congress which drafted the Constitution of 1824. He worked with Carlos María Bustamante in editing the newspaper "Correo Americano del Sur". Quintana Roo served as Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs under Emperor Agustín de Iturbide, from 1822 to 1823. He also served as a Justice of the Supreme Court (1824–1827) and as a federal deputy representing the state of México. He founded the newspaper "Semanario Patriótico" and also wrote the book "Dieciséis de septiembre" ("The Sixteenth of September"). He died on April 15, 1851, in Mexico City. His remains lie next to those of his wife, Leona, in the mausoleum of the Column of Independence in Mexico City. Hernández González, Manuel. La emigración canaria a América. Page 44.

She is better known by her ring name Krissy Vaine and also for her time in World Wrestling Entertainment. She also trained at WWE's developmental territories Deep South Wrestling and Florida Championship Wrestling before leaving the company on October 10, 2007 due to family issues. Eubanks made her wrestling debut in September 2000 as Special K, where she acted as a manager for wrestlers. By mid-2003, she transitioned from a managerial role to an in-ring competitor and subsequently adopted the ring name Krissy Vaine. In 2004, Vaine began teaming with Amber O'Neal and the pair were soon named Team Blondage. After a few tryouts with World Wrestling Entertainment on both "SmackDown!" and "Raw", Eubanks began working for several independent promotions, including the Professional Girl Wrestling Association, Women's Extreme Wrestling, Memphis Wrestling, the National Wrestling Alliance and Shimmer Women Athletes. In January 22, 2006, Eubanks signed a developmental contract with WWE and was assigned to Deep South Wrestling. Eubanks, under her Krissy Vaine name, made her first DSW appearance at the March 9, 2006 tapings where she and Kristal Marshall threw T-shirts into the crowd during intermission. Her official debut occurred at the March 16 tapings, where she appeared as a referee. In addition to refereeing, she also managed Kevin Matthews during his matches.

At the October 12 tapings, Vaine became the General Manager for DSW. In late 2006 and early 2007, she began a feud with Angel Williams, with Williams claiming that Vaine did something immoral to be appointed General Manager. In response, Vaine began to cost Williams matches with distractions from other Divas. She then tried to order around the other Divas, such as Nattie Neidhart, Brooke Adams and Shantelle Taylor to take care of Williams for her, though to no avail. Instead, Vaine decided to try to make up with Williams, with the latter accepting the apology and resulting in them both becoming the co-General Managers of DSW.

However, both Eubanks and her boyfriend Ryan O'Reilly left WWE on October 10 due to health issues with both of their families. After a nearly two-year-long hiatus from professional wrestling following her WWE departure, Eubanks made her return to the wrestling industry on February 2, 2009, where she reunited with Amber O'Neal to reform Team Blondage and defeat Daffney and MsChif in a tag team match. On September 12, 2009, Vaine won her first singles championship by defeating Jayme Jameson to win the NWA Mid-Atlantic Women's Championship. The win made Vaine the first champion in nearly nine years due to the title being vacated and subsequently abandoned on December 2, 2000 by the last champion Leilani Kai. Soon after winning the title, Vaine renamed herself Kristin Astara before losing the title to Jameson on April 10, 2010.

He succeeded his father Ramabhadra. Bhoja was a devotee of Vishnu and adopted the title of "Adivaraha" which is inscribed on some of his coins. One of the outstanding political figures of India in ninth century, he ranks with Dhruva Dharavarsha and Dharmapala as a great general and empire builder. At its height, Bhoja's empire extended to Narmada River in the South, Sutlej River in the northwest, and up to Bengal in the east. It extended over a large area from the foot of the Himalayas up to the river Narmada and included the present district of Etawah in Uttar Pradesh. During his reign, the capital was in Kannauj (present-day Uttar Pradesh), during his period Kannauj was referred as Panchala. He was a bitter enemy of the Arab invaders who, according to an Arab chronicler, Sulaiman, maintained a large army and had a fine cavalry. The territories under his rule were prosperous and safe from robbers. His state was rich in natural resources, especially gold and silver mines. Many temples made by him still survive. Teli Mandir, near Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, marks the presence of Vishnu on earth. The temple's architecture, design and layout features an outstanding fusion of architectural styles: the roof resembles a Dravidian style while the decoration highlights the art of North India. He was succeeded by his son Mahendrapala I (c.836 - 910 CE). When Mihira Bhoja started his career reverses and defeats suffered by his father Ramabhadra had considerably lowered the prestige of the Royal Gurjara Pratihara family. He invaded the Pala Empire of Bengal, but was defeated by Devapala. He then launched a campaign to conquer the territories to the south of his empire and was successful. After Devapala's death, Bhoja defeated the Pala King Narayanapala and the Rashtrakuta ruler Krishna II. He gradually rebuilt the empire by conquest of territories in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The Chandelas of Bundelkhand acknowledged his suzerainty. Besides being a conqueror, Bhoja was a great diplomat. According to the sources (inscriptions found in Gawilor) Mihira Bhoja defeated Dharmapala the ruler of Pala Empire. But defeated by his son Devapala. There are other sources which claims that Mihira Bhoja defeated some of the Arab rulers of the northwest. Mihira Bhoja's epithet was "Srimad-Adivaraha" (the fortunate primeval boar incarnation of Vishnu) and therefore there is a broad agreement amongst the scholars on the attribution of "adivaraha dramma" billon coins to him. These coins have a depiction of "Adivaraha" on the obverse. </doc> <doc id="2341047" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341047" title="Vivekananda Vidya Mandir"> Vivekananda Vidya Mandir Vivekananda Vidya Mandir is an English Medium co-educational school from KG to Class XII affiliated to the CBSE Board, New Delhi.

In late November 1790 the ship narrowly avoided destruction when lightning struck her whilst she was in Portsmouth harbour. The main topmast exploded but did not plunge through the quarterdeck as it was still held by the toprope. In 1801 Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson chose "Elephant" as his flagship during the Battle of Copenhagen due to its suitability for the shallow waters there. It was on this ship that he is said to have put his telescope to his blind eye and claimed not to be able to see a signal ordering him to withdraw. In mid-1803, the squadron under Captain Henry William Bayntun, consisting of , , , "Elephant", and captured "Poisson Volant" and . The Royal Navy took both into service. The ship participated in the Blockade of Saint-Domingue in the same year. The British patrolled off Cap-François. On 24 July the squadron, made up of "Bellerophon", "Elephant", , and HMS "Vanguard", came across two French 74-gun ships, "Duquesne" and "Duguay-Trouin", and the frigate "Guerrière", attempting to escape from Cap-François. The squadron gave chase, and on 25 July overhauled and captured "Duquesne" after a few shots were fired, while "Duguay-Trouin" and "Guerrière" managed to evade their pursuers and escape to France. One man was killed aboard "Bellerophon" during the pursuit. "Elephant" remained blockading Cap-François until November, when the French commander of the garrison there, General Rochambeau, was forced to surrender. To prevent Rochambeau escaping, launches from "Bellerophon" and "Elephant" went into the Caracol Passage where they cut out the French schooner "Découverte" on 22-23 November. The French formally surrendered on 30 November. "Elephant" was reduced to a 58-gun fourth-rate in 1818, and broken up in 1830. </doc> <doc id="2341066" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341066" title="Rubric (academic)"> Rubric (academic) In education terminology, rubric means "a scoring guide used to evaluate the quality of students' constructed responses". Rubrics usually contain evaluative criteria, quality definitions for those criteria at particular levels of achievement, and a scoring strategy. They are often presented in table format and can be used by teachers when marking, and by students when planning their work. Rubrics, when used with formative assessment purposes, have shown to have a positive impact on students' learning. A scoring rubric is an attempt to communicate expectations of quality around a task. In many cases, scoring rubrics are used to delineate consistent criteria for grading. Because the criteria are public, a scoring rubric allows teachers and students alike to evaluate criteria, which can be complex and subjective. A scoring rubric can also provide a basis for self-evaluation, reflection, and peer review. It is aimed at accurate and fair assessment, fostering understanding, and indicating a way to proceed with subsequent learning/teaching. This integration of performance and feedback is called ongoing assessment or formative assessment. Several common features of scoring rubrics can be distinguished, according to Bernie Dodge and Nancy Pickett: Scoring rubrics include one or more dimensions on which performance is rated, definitions and examples that illustrate the attribute(s) being measured, and a rating scale for each dimension. Dimensions are generally referred to as criteria, the rating scale as levels, and definitions as descriptors. Herman, Aschbacher, and Winters distinguish the following elements of a scoring rubric: Since the 1980s, many scoring rubrics have been presented in a graphic format, typically as a grid. Studies of scoring rubric effectiveness now consider the efficiency of a grid over, say, a text-based list of criteria. Rubrics can be classified as holistic or analytic. Holistic rubrics integrate all aspects of the work into a single overall rating of the work. For example, "the terms and grades commonly used at university (i.e., excellent – A, good – B, average – C, poor – D, and weak – E) usually express an assessor’s overall rating of a piece of work. When a research article or thesis is evaluated, the reviewer is asked to express their opinion in holistic terms – accept as is, accept with minor revisions, require major revisions for a second review, or reject. The classification response is a weighted judgement by the assessor taking all things into account at once; hence, holistic. In contrast, an analytic rubric specifies various dimensions or components of the product or process that are evaluated separately. The same rating scale labels may be used as the holistic, but it is applied to various key dimensions or aspects separately rather than an integrated judgement. This separate specification means that on one dimension the work could be excellent, but on one or more other dimensions the work might be poor to average. Most commonly, analytic rubrics have been used by teachers to score student writing when the teacher awards a separate score for such facets of written language as conventions or mechanics (i.e., spelling, punctuation, and grammar), organisation, content or ideas, and style. They are also used in many other domains of the school curriculum (e.g., performing arts, sports and athletics, studio arts, wood and metal technologies, etc.). By breaking the whole into significant dimensions or components and rating them separately, it is expected that better information will be obtained by the teacher and the student about what needs to be worked on next." (Brown, Irving, & Keegan, 2014, p. 55). Scoring rubrics may help students become thoughtful evaluators of their own and others’ work and may reduce the amount of time teachers spend evaluating student work. Here is a seven-step method to creating and using a scoring rubric for writing assignments: Additionally, for the implementation of self-assessment and peer assessment, that can be done with rubrics, there is a list of recommendations. Importantly, rubrics can be co-created with the students to increase their comprehension and use of the assessment criteria. It can be used in individual assessment within the course, or a project or capstone project. However, it can ideally be used when multiple evaluators are evaluating the assessment to get focus on the contributing attributes for the evaluation. The traditional meanings of the word "rubric" stem from "a heading on a document (often written in red — from Latin, "rubrica", red ochre, red ink), or a direction for conducting church services". Drawing on definition 2 in the OED for this word rubrics referred to the instructions on a test to the test-taker as to how questions were to be answered. In modern education circles, rubrics have recently come to refer to an assessment tool. The first usage of the term in this new sense is from the mid-1990s, but scholarly articles from that time do not explain why the term was co-opted. Perhaps rubrics are seen to act, in both cases, as metadata added to text to indicate what constitutes a successful use of that text. It may also be that the color of the traditional red marking pen is the common link. As shown in the 1977 introduction to the International Classification of Diseases-9, the term has long been used as medical labels for diseases and procedures. The bridge from medicine to education occurred through the construction of "Standardized Developmental Ratings." These were first defined for writing assessment in the mid-1970s and used to train raters for New York State's Regents Exam in Writing by the late 1970s. That exam required raters to use multidimensional standardized developmental ratings to determine a holistic score. The term "rubrics" was applied to such ratings by Grubb, 1981 in a book advocating holistic scoring rather than developmental rubrics. Developmental rubrics return to the original intent of standardized developmental ratings, which was to support student self-reflection and self-assessment as well as communication between an assessor and those being assessed. In this new sense, a scoring rubric is a set of criteria and standards typically linked to learning objectives. It is used to assess or communicate about product, performance, or process tasks. One problem with scoring rubrics is that each level of fulfillment encompasses a wide range of marks. For example, if two students both receive a 'level four' mark on the Ontario system, one might receive an 80% and the other 100%. In addition, a small change in scoring rubric evaluation caused by a small mistake may lead to an unnecessarily large change in numerical grade. Adding further distinctions between levels does not solve the problem, because more distinctions make discrimination even more difficult. Both scoring problems may be alleviated by treating the definitions of levels as typical descriptions of whole products rather than the details of every element in them. Scoring rubrics may also make marking schemes more complicated for students. Showing one mark may be inaccurate, as receiving a perfect score in one section may not be very significant in the long run if that specific strand is not weighted heavily. Some may also find it difficult to comprehend an assignment having multiple distinct marks, and therefore it is unsuitable for some younger children. In such cases it is better to incorporate the rubrics into conversation with the child than to give a mark on a paper. For example, a child who writes an "egocentric" story (depending too much on ideas not accessible to the reader) might be asked what her best friend thinks of it (suggesting a move in the audience dimension to the "correspondence" level). Thus, when used effectively scoring rubrics help students to improve their weaknesses. Multidimensional rubrics also allow students to compensate for a lack of ability in one strand by improving another one. For instance, a student who has difficulty with sentence structure may still be able to attain a relatively high mark, if sentence structure is not weighted as heavily as other dimensions such as audience, perspective or time frame. Another advantage of a scoring rubric is that it clearly shows what criteria must be met for a student to demonstrate quality on a product, process, or performance task. Scoring rubrics can also improve scoring consistency. Grading is more reliable while using a rubric than with out one. Educators can refer to a rubric while scoring assignments to keep grading consistent between students. Teachers can also use rubrics to keep their scoring consistent between other teachers who teach the same class. </doc> <doc id="2341067" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341067" title="Lodowicke Muggleton"> Lodowicke Muggleton Lodowicke Muggleton (1609–1698) was an English religious thinker, who gave his name to Muggletonianism, a Protestant sect which was always small, but survived until the death of its last follower in 1979. He spent his working life as a journeyman tailor in the City of London and was imprisoned twice for his beliefs. He held opinions hostile to all forms of philosophical reason, and had received only a basic education. He encouraged quietism and free-thought amongst his followers whose beliefs were predestinarian in a manner that was distinct from Calvinism. Near the close of his long life, Muggleton wrote his spiritual autobiography which was published posthumously. Lodowicke Muggleton was born at a house called Walnut Tree Yard on Bishopsgate Street (now Bishopsgate) in the City of London. His father, John, was a farrier and a post office contractor. Lodowicke was the youngest of three children when his mother, Mary, died in 1612. On his father's remarriage, Lodowicke was put out to nurse in the country, the common practice in such family restructuring at the time. In 1624 he returned to Walnut Tree Yard as an apprentice to a tailor, John Quick. Quick seems to have been well-connected, making ceremonial gowns for Liverymen and Common Councilmen. Muggleton describes him as "a quiet peaceable man, not cruel to servants, which liked me very well". In 1625 Muggleton contracted the plague but, he says, "it was not extreme tedious to me. I recovered quickly, and hath not had half a day's sickness since." As his apprenticeship drew to a close he began to disdain tailoring as poorly paid. He was offered a stake in a pawnbroker's business by a Mrs Richardson if he would marry her daughter which he seemed keen to do. But he became worried that usury would damn his soul so he remained unmarried, working as a tailor for William Reeve who was John Reeve's elder brother and, at that time, a staunch Puritan. Yet his soul was still troubled "for fear God had made me a reprobate before I was born, because He did not answer my prayers." His first marriage, 1635, was to Sarah and they had two surviving daughters, Sarah and Elizabeth. After his wife's death he married again but both wife and the children that she bore soon died. Muggleton fell away from the Puritan faith, "for all the zeal we formerly had was quite worn out," and this cost his business dearly in terms of lost customers from that congregation. It may be possible to recognise some subsequent Muggletonian beliefs as being solutions to the perplexities he felt whilst still a Puritan. Then again, the episodes he chooses to tell in his autobiography may be selected with such a didactic purpose in mind. The idea that conscience is God's watchman within every person, that the conflict between two natures is at work within everyone, and the need to banish the fear of being prey to external spirits all seem to stem from personal exigencies of this period in his life. "It came to pass in the year 1650, I heard of several prophets and prophetess that were about the streets and declared the Day of the Lord, and many other wonderful things." Notable were John Robins and Thomas Tany (Muggleton calls him John Tannye). Muggleton says of Robins that he regarded himself as God come to judge the quick and the dead and, as such, had resurrected and redeemed Cain and Judas Iscariot as well as resurrecting Jeremiah and many of the Old Testament prophets. "I have had nine or ten of them at my house at a time," reports Muggleton, nonchalantly. The prophets claimed power to damn any that opposed them. Robins displayed considerable talents as a magus; presenting the appearance of angels, burning shining lights, half-moons and stars in chambers, thick darkness with his head in a flame of fire and his person riding on the wings of the wind. Understandably, such experiences left a lasting impression on Muggleton. "I do not speak this from hearsay of others," says Muggleton in his autobiography, "but from a perfect knowledge which I have seen and heard." Yet he asserts he was never an active follower of either man. "Yet was I quiet and still and heard what was said and done and spake against nothing." Muggleton makes clear he believed Robins guilty of self-deification and of indulging in dangerous powers when he had no grounds to consider them of divine origin. Thus Robins was a false prophet with lying signs. Yet, writing in old age, Muggleton still appreciates Robins' efficacy. Robins' curses were true for all eternity because his opponents, when they jeered at him, had no idea whether he was sent from God or not and "would have said as much to the true Christ as they did to him." Muggleton concluded that more sober persons, in whom faith predominated, "would have been preserved from speaking evil of things they knew not." By April 1651, Muggleton had begun to feel that he lacked the power to reason his way out of his perplexities about resurrection and hellfire. He concluded that he must leave it all to God: "even as the potter doth what he will with the dead clay." Yet, were he to be satisfied with this equilibrium at a conscious level, his night-time thoughts would work differently. He began to experience revelations concerning the meaning of scripture. The following January his cousin John Reeve underwent similar experiences. Both men thought such things for their private peace of mind alone and they resolved to make nothing public. "But contrary to the resolutions of them both, a little while after, were made the greatest medlers of religion in all the world." On 3 February 1651 (which is 1652 new style) John Reeve was addressed by the voice of God giving him the Third Commission. Lodowicke Muggleton was to be his mouth, as Aaron was to Moses. They were the two witnesses mentioned in . Thus began the sect to be known as Muggletonians. John Reeve was 42, Lodowicke Muggleton 41. Sarah Muggleton (14 years at the time) was the first person to be blessed under the new commission. The next task of Reeve, Muggleton and Thomas Turner (the latter presumably taken along for verification) was to go pronounce sentence of eternal damnation on Thomas Tany for disobedience to the Third Commission. The following day Reeve, Muggleton and Dorcas Booth went to curse John Robins in prison. His offence, in Reeve's view, was deceiving the people. What "thou has measured to others must be measured again to thee." It may seem incredible to modern readers that two ordinary tailors could walk around London considering themselves to be transcendental characters out of the Book of Revelation. Christopher Hill supplies the answer when he quotes a Royalist prophet, Arise Evans, as saying (1629) that before he came to London he "looked upon the Scripture as a history of things that passed in other countries, pertaining to other persons; but now I looked upon it as a mystery to be opened at this time, belonging also to us." Thomas Macaulay in his "History of England" (1849), describes Lodowicke Muggleton as "a mad tailor who wandered from pothouse to pothouse, tippling ale and denouncing eternal torments against all who refused to believe." Subsequent historians have treated this as slanderous (as it may be for the subsequent history of the faith) but it is not so different from Muggleton's own description of his early, lively adventures as a prophet. "For God's sake, Lodowick, let us be gone, else we shall be killed: so he paid for the drink and we departed out of the house and went to another a little distance off." Throughout the period until the death of John Reeve in 1658, Muggleton seems to have acted only as Reeve's ever-present sidekick. There is no record of him writing any works of his own nor of him acting independently of Reeve. The pair were tried for blasphemy and jailed for six months in 1653/4. It is said that, on the death of John Reeve, there was a power-struggle between Lodowicke Muggleton and Laurence Clarkson (or Claxton) for leadership. However, it is unclear if Muggleton saw there as being a "movement" of which to be leader. William Lamont remarks that it is strange that he took three years to bestir himself in his own cause. The issue may be more a misunderstanding on Clarkson's part. In temperament and talent, he seemed much more the natural successor to Reeve than Muggleton was – or cared to be. But he wasn't a commissioned prophet. Muggleton seems only slowly to have grasped that if he wanted to be taken seriously as an individual prophet, he had to write, to publish and to show himself outside his immediate neighbourhood. "The first thing I did after Claxton was put down, I caused A Divine Looking-Glass to be printed anew in 1661." Secondly, he wrote his first book, "The Interpretation of the Eleventh Chapter of the Revelation of St. John" in 1662. Thirdly, he began his reluctant travels to distant parts of England to meet believers who knew him only through correspondence. He did no preaching although he records acrimonious discussions with followers of Jacob Boehme. His first journey was to see Ellen Sudbury in Nottingham and Dorothy Carter in Chesterfield. This was followed by visits to believers in Cambridgeshire and Kent. Although these visits were made troublesome by local opponents (mainly Quakers) and resulted in Muggleton spending nine days in Derby gaol, the visit to Kent had a happy outcome because Muggleton married his third wife, Mary Martin, the daughter of a wealthy tanner. The marriage seems to have been an exceptionally happy one and she brought with her sufficient wealth to allow her husband to retire from tailoring, if not from prophecy. Muggleton made a further journey to these areas, and to Leicestershire, in 1669. It was during these years that Muggleton began his polemic against the Quakers with a book "The Neck of the Quakers broken" (1663) and correspondence with individual Quakers, much of it published by one party or the other. Muggleton's opposition to the Quakers, and to all things Quaker, was uncharacteristically bitter for three reasons. Firstly, he believed them guilty of "spiritual witchcraft" which he saw as a manipulation of that fear from which faith should be free. Secondly, he regarded them as unreconstructed Ranters and the Ranter legacy was a delicate personal issue. Thirdly, they were the seventh, and last, anti-church of the latter days and thus their mere existence was seen as holding up everyone else's journey to paradise. By and large, the charges Muggleton brings against the Quakers are the same as those the Quakers lay against Muggleton. As a result, the exchange of letters and pamphlets rarely rises above contradiction, quibbling and name-calling; the latter Muggleton employs with great verve. Richard Farnesworth (1662) brusquely tells Muggleton that his commission has been faked and that he is trying to act as judge in the stead of Christ. What, he asks, has happened to the pardoning power of Christ? In turn, Muggleton asks what Quakers would have said to St. Peter after he had been given the keys to the kingdom, the power to bind and to loose, the power to remit or to retain sin, all whilst still a man? He jeers at Quaker "out-sputterings" so that, "Christ hath never a body of his own but is forced to make use of every Quaker's body for his spirit to dwell in." One of Muggleton's more telling criticisms of the Quakers is that they try too hard to entice God to move in their direction, thus falling into the trap of seeing their own lights and fancies as coming to them from without. Muggleton does not allow that the Quakers themselves may have been well aware of the dangers. As a result, Muggleton dismisses Quakers as warmed-over Ranters, "for you have got your Christ all within you." Edward Bourne asks Muggleton if the two seeds theology does not make God the harbinger of evil in the world? He does not receive a straight answer although Muggleton says that faith in a time of innocence is one thing, but that faith through knowledge of good and evil is a higher state of consciousness altogether. Thus, evil is a sort of necessary evil. Samuel Hooten enquires if Muggleton should not pay heed to the instruction Christ gave to his disciples, "Bless and curse not"? But Muggleton dismisses this instruction as a temporary expedient for the disciples' use only. In Acts, St. Peter receives a quite different instruction and Peter, like Lodowicke, has a commission. In a similar vein, Muggleton is reminded there is nothing in scripture foretelling the coming of one Lodowicke Muggleton, to which the reply is, "For, if there had been such a name written in scripture, many men would have named their sons Lodowicke Muggleton." Richard Farnesworth also taxes Muggleton about the failure of John Reeve and himself to live out their part from the book of Revelation. Muggleton says that prophets come to impose their commission which lives on after them no matter what happens to the prophet himself. Thus, Moses commission was to bring the law and that did not end with the death of Moses but with the death of John the Baptist. In 1669, Muggleton's "An answer to Isaac Pennington, Quaker" was intercepted at the printers by the Searcher of the Press. "It came to pass, in the year 1670, before midsummer, there came fourteen men to search my house for unlicensed books." Muggleton, discovering these men to be honest and courteous, sent a bribe after them when they had gone. Being honest men, he knew they would only accept the bribe if they felt they could help him. When the bribe was returned, Muggleton knew for certain he was in serious trouble. Shortly afterwards, he was tipped off that a warrant for his arrest would be issued and he was able to disappear for nine months to live in hiding amongst the watermen of Wapping. During his absence, a rebellion against his authority broke out amongst the believers led by a scrivener called William Medgate. The rebels alleged that Muggleton had made "nine assertions" contrary to "all sober reason". Muggleton regarded these as boiling down to one issue; whether God took notice of happenings on earth. But two other grievances seemed to be involved. Firstly, whether the prophet was using his authority to surpass the words of Christ. Secondly, whether the prophet's love could uphold believers who sinned, this being alleged to be antinomian doctrine. John Saddington rallied the believers to stick with Muggleton and the revolt lost momentum. One of its leaders, Thomas Burton, a flax dealer, rejoined the flock. In 1675, Muggleton, as executor of the estate of Deborah Brunt, became involved in property litigation against Alderman John James. He seems largely to have been successful until his opponent hit upon the idea of trying to get him excommunicated in the Court of Arches so that he could no longer have defence of law in civil matters. At the time, Muggleton was in hiding at the house of Ann Lowe, a believer, from an arrest warrant of the Stationers Company. Hiding was now no longer a solution as Muggleton could be excommunicated in his absence if he did not appear and plead. On doing so, Muggleton was remanded to Guildhall Court on a warrant of the Lord Chief Justice. It was Muggleton's ill-luck that the Lord Mayor that year was a stationer. Muggleton was bailed to appear to answer charges arising from his book "The Neck of the Quakers broken", specifically that he did curse Dr Edward Bourne of Worcester, therein. Muggleton remarks that it was strange that a curse against a Quaker should be considered blasphemy by the established church. Muggleton's problem was that it was common practice for recently published dissenting books to bear false dates and places of publication to escape the law. Muggleton's bore a false place (Amsterdam, not London) but a true date, some 13 years earlier, and he should have escaped prosecution. No evidence, other than innuendo, was offered by the prosecution. On 17 January 1676 (1677 new style) Muggleton was tried at the Old Bailey, convicted of blasphemy, and sentenced to three days in the pillory and a fine of £500. At each of his three two-hourly appearances in the pillory (at Temple Gate, outside the Royal Exchange and at the market in West Smithfield) a selection of the books seized from Muggleton were burnt by the common hangman. Considerable public disturbance arose from fights between Muggleton's supporters and members of the public who felt deprived of their sport. Nevertheless, Muggleton (who was no longer a young man) was badly injured. Muggleton's attempts to get himself released from Newgate gaol were frustrated because his keepers were reluctant to let go a prisoner from whom they could derive a profit. Muggleton was advised to get Ann Lowe to sue him for debt so that a writ of habeas corpus would remove him from Newgate to the Fleet prison. Eventually, the Sheriff of London, Sir John Peak was persuaded to release Muggleton for a payment of £100 cash down. Lodowicke Muggleton died on 14 March 1697 (1698 new style) aged 88. His third wife, Mary, died on 1 July 1718. Both were buried in the New Churchyard, Bethlem. In 1832, some sixty Muggletonians subscribed to bring out a complete edition of "The Miscellaneous Works of Reeve and Muggleton" in 3 vols. Muggleton's likeness is known. A copy of one of his books seized by the Stationers' Company and now in the Lambeth Palace Library, London is inscribed, "he had yellow hair and a ruddy complexion." His death-mask also exists, somewhat battered from attempts to take copies, in the care of the National Portrait Gallery, London. By far the most technically accomplished portrait is a miniature by Samuel Cooper now part of the Pierpont Morgan collection. Mr Morgan had bought it from a family of Derbyshire Muggletonians but it is not known how it came to be painted and, although possessing the yellow hair, does give the appearance of being a stock portrait of a Puritan type. Definitely painted from life is the work by William Wood of Braintree, who was a friend of Lodowicke Muggleton. This was done in 1692 but shows Muggleton at an earlier stage of life. It was subsequently purchased by Isaac Frost for the London congregation and now, extensively and beautifully restored, belongs to the University of Sussex. From this painting an engraving was made in 1829 by J. Kennerley at the expense of the Frost family for use as a frontispiece to publications and to be sold as a separate card. It was subsequently reproduced as a small photographic print. From the death-mask a contemporary engraving was made by G. V. Casseel. The plate was still in the possession of the Muggletonians when Alexander Gordon visited in 1869 but was too worn to be used. A version of this engraving is reproduced on the dust jacket of "The World of the Muggletonians". From the engraving, a small oil painting was made by a Muggletonian, Richard Pickersgill (possibly related to Frederick Richard Pickersgill) in 1813. Several copies existed but it seems all have been lost. Fortunately, one was photographed by Hallett Hyatt in 1913 and appears in George Williamson's book opposite page 18. Even at that time, it was clearly in a decayed state. On a visit to the British Museum, the Frost brothers were delighted to find a painting of Muggleton on display. It had been presented in 1758 and appears to have been dated 1674. Alexander Gordon was familiar with it and calls it the best of the Muggletonian paintings. It was a small oval-styled oil painting featuring head and bust and with the sitter looking to his right. It is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London to which it was transferred in 1879. As well as the likenesses themselves, these is also a contemporary interpretation of Muggleton's appearance. Charles Leslie said, "it has been observed of great enthusiasts that their hair is generally slank, without any curl, which proceeds from a moisture of brain that inclines to folly." Lodowicke Muggleton wrote two commentaries on the Book of Revelation. William Lamont sees the first work as part of a power struggle with Laurence Clarkson, but admits, "If Muggleton's motivation in writing his comments on Chapter XI of Revelation was to complete the doing-down of Clarkson, it is therefore, a signal failure." So there is room for doubt if this is the whole explanation. Muggleton himself says his intention is to prophesy anew: "whereby is unfolded, and plainly declared, the whole counsel of God concerning Himself, the Devil and all Mankind from the foundation of the world to all eternity. Never before revealed." Muggleton stresses he writes "without the help of other men's labours, but only as the revelation did arise in me from the seed of faith". Hence Muggleton's first book is not a commentary upon Revelation but something new which uses Revelation as a starting point. Is Muggleton entirely prophecy? It is hard to see what value "theology" would have in a Muggletonian setting since such a project would surely be contaminated by unclean human reason. Muggleton starts his consideration of Chapter 11 at Chapter 10, verse 8 where an angel hands John of Patmos a little book which he must eat with the command, "Thou must prophesy again." This is a direct repetition of Ezekiel's commissioning as a prophet. As Ezekiel, so John. As John, so Muggleton. Muggleton seeks not only to explain the text of Revelation on its own terms but also to appropriate the text as a foundation for the Muggletonian faith. "Post-modernism is reader-orientated and gives readers the power of interpreting a text that, in modern terms, belongs to the author." In that sense, Muggleton is an empowered post-modern. He thought so, too. "Herein is the glory of God the more seen, in that he has chosen the weak things to bring down the strong; the foolish things to confound the wise; and the things that seem as if they were not, to bring to nought things that are." This is the Muggletonian faith working from the margins. But his important point is about the glory of God being seen more clearly in what might otherwise be mistaken as being the works of humankind. Austin Farrer says that when interpreting Revelation "we need constantly to ask ourselves, 'Would St. John admit that this is what he meant?'" and Muggleton seems to understand John perfectly at this juncture. Revelation is believed to have been written slightly before 100 CE. It was written by an impassioned and embittered Christian exile on the island of Patmos. We know him only as John the Divine. The book purports to be addressed to seven churches on the mainland (now Turkey) warning them against laxity and compromise with Roman authority, Greek and gnostic philosophy, and with Christian schismatics. His message is bleakly fundamentalist; about being ready for the imminent end of the world. It is a brutal narrative for a brutalised community. Luther could find little of the Christ in it. But Gerd Luedemann tells us more about the historical background. "This had unpleasant aspects, and destroys once and for all the idea that circumstances in earliest Christianity were pure and ideal. Polemic between the two sides" reached such a pitch that sometimes it is no longer even clear what the substantive or theological issues were ... Christians threatened to tear one another limb from limb, caught up in a mishmash of mutual misunderstanding, violence but also self-assertion. It is this last phrase – self-assertion – that perfectly characterises John the Divine. The view he wished to impose upon others is that the old earth and the old heaven will soon pass away and a New Jerusalem will "descend" to enable the elect to dwell in God's real presence. God is working his purpose out precisely because, to ordinary human understanding, the very opposite seems to be happening. John lays bare, without a trace of sentiment, that people will only be prepared to leave vengeance to the Lord if they are certain that, when the Lord finally does come, vengeance is what he'll bring. Revelation is a story of how apparent delay and present weakness will only make the final judgment more emphatic. Revelation is, in Elisabeth Schuessler Fiorenza's view, a "vision of a just world". Some might argue that John seeks vindication rather than justice and at a cost of the entire universe going up in flames along the way. Alison Jack says "Schuessler Fiorenza is keen to rehabilitate Revelation for all readers. Other feminist critics are less sanguine about the possibility of the recovery of the text." It is perhaps advisable to remember that there is a very real sense in which Muggleton's everyday experiences were much closer to those of John the Divine than ours are. In 1653, the weekly newspaper "Mercurius Politicus" sent their ace-reporter Marchamont Nedham down Bow Lane to investigate "the world of the Muggletonians". Christopher Hill tells us what he found. "Nedham took 'a citizen of worth out of Bread Street' with him, and at a chandler's shop in Great Trinity Lane, 'against one Mr Millis a brown-baker, near Bow Lane end' found 'a couple of tailors together with two women and an old country plain man of Essex ... at the top of an old house in a cockloft.' He bought a 12d pamphlet from them." Muggleton also cursed the citizen of worth, presumably free of charge. At first sight, it might seem surprising that Muggleton is impressed by John the Divine's visions. After all, the proof that John Reeve's calling had been authentic was supposed to have been because it was by voice of God, "as a man speaks to his friend" and not by visions which might be self-deceiving. In Jewish practice of John's time, visions came through meditation upon a message and a favourite vehicle was the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel which is a centre-piece of Revelation. John Sweet explains how the idea is handled in Revelation. When John is spoken to, it is to explain the meaning of what he has seen; just as Mary Magdalene had seen Jesus in the garden but did not recognise him until she heard his voice. When John the Divine witnesses the Lamb he sees weakness and defeat but the voice explains it all as power and victory. John is handling his own sources here. In the Book of Daniel 12:4 "But you, Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end." Lodowicke Muggleton was aware that Revelation is not simply reportage of visions. He likens the book to a heavenly building upon a foundation. This emphasis on structure as a key to meaning in Revelation has modern adherents, too. Austin Farrer elucidates a complex set of structures in which names can be broken down to give the qualities of the things so named, the tribes of Israel are used interchangeably with the houses of the zodiac, actual historical events are slid around in the interests of rhetoric, the referent of new metaphor is an older metaphor and the beginning of each new series is the culmination of some (perhaps half-forgotten) previous series. Were this not so, it would be difficult to account for the survival of ancient prophecy. Prophecy is not the mere foretelling of future events. For a prophecy to survive, it requires a timeless, meaningful structure into which the pressing features of succeeding eras can be fitted. Thus an old prophecy can be reused over and over again whilst acquiring kudos from its longevity. Otherwise, apocalyptic literature would have been discarded for its many instances of failed prediction. The old content can be written over with new meanings whilst the framework is retained and reused. An example of failed prophecy with which Revelation itself had to adjust was that most of Jewish apocalyptic had assumed that the Temple would be desecrated by the gentiles, using as its prototype for this the earlier experiences of just such desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes. When Titus raised the building and marched onward, the event failed to conform to its predicted type. Many readers find the content of Revelation to be difficult, disturbing and repugnant. Seeing structure as a way into its message may be important. Otherwise, there may be no way in at all. What is the message? Or, as Christopher Rowland puts it more radically, "Can we read St. John any way we like?" He concludes that Christ himself is the restraint, even if it did not seem to restrain John the Divine. Tina Pippin offers a dual message: Death & Desire. "Entering into the fictional world of the Apocalypse involves facing fear and a whole range of feelings." Overcoming his own fears along exactly these lines was what had motivated Muggleton in the first place. He would certainly have endorsed the importance of death and desire. His notion of the second death is exactly that of John the Divine's, from where he may have obtained it. Desire is always the motivating force of reason and in opposition to faith. No one could have expressed the message of faith more grimly than John the Divine. Everyone in his vision offered repentance spurns their chance. One senses John saying, "See, I told you thus." To John it is putting in the hours of worship and praise to God that matter: repentance is mere subjective froth. For Muggleton, it is faith – the opposite of reason – that matters. John Sweet feels the ethical problem misunderstood. It is wrong to see the destruction that occurs in Revelation as acts of God. Rather the destruction is a direct result of the sins of humankind rebounding upon their own heads. He cites ecological catastrophe as an example of this. Others see it differently, arguing that it was adherence to apocalyptic thinking which caused the complete destruction of Jewish society in second century Palestine. Maybe this is why the end of the world in Muggletonian beliefs differs from Revelation; the reprobate are left to stew in the world they have ruined whilst the elect ascend to a world where all things are created new. </doc> <doc id="2341068" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341068" title="Rubric"> Rubric A rubric is a word or section of text that is traditionally written or printed in red ink for emphasis. The word derives from the , meaning red ochre or red chalk, and originates in Medieval illuminated manuscripts from the 13th century or earlier. In these, red letters were used to highlight initial capitals (particularly of psalms), section headings and names of religious significance, a practice known as rubrication, which was a separate stage in the production of a manuscript. Rubric can also mean the red ink or paint used to make rubrics, or the pigment used to make it. Although red was most often used, other colours came into use from the late Middle Ages onwards, and the word rubric was used for these also. Various figurative senses of the word have been extended from its original meaning. Usually these senses are used within the set phrase "under [whatever] rubric," for example, "under this rubric, [X is true]," or "[X was done] under the rubric of Y." These senses are defined in part by "Merriam-Webster's Collegiate" as follows: "an authoritative rule"; "the title of a statute"; "something under which a thing is classed : CATEGORY"; "an explanatory or introductory commentary : GLOSS"; "an established rule, tradition, or custom"; "a guide listing specific criteria for grading or scoring academic [assignments]." (See "Merriam-Webster's Collegiate" for the full listing.) Instructions for a priest explaining what he must do during a liturgy were also rubricated in missals and the other liturgical books, and the texts to be spoken aloud were in black. From this, "rubric" has a secondary denotation of an instruction in a text, regardless of how it is actually inscribed. This is the oldest recorded definition in English, found in 1375. Less formally, "rubrics" may refer to any liturgical action customarily performed, whether or not pursuant to a written instruction. The history, status, and authority of the content of rubrics are significant, and sometimes controversial, among liturgical scholars. In the past, some theologians distinguished between rubrics they considered of Divine origin and those merely of human origin. Rubrics were probably originally verbal, and then written in separate volumes. The earliest extant liturgical books do not contain them, but from references in texts of the first millennium it appears that written versions existed. Full rubrics regarding matters such as vesture, appearance of the altar, timing of specific liturgies, and similar matters still may be published separately. In modern liturgical books, e. g. the Catholic "Roman Missal", lengthy general rubrics, probably printed in black, pertain to such matters and preface the actual order of liturgies, which contain shorter, specific rubrics that still are usually rubricated. Red is also often used to distinguish words spoken by the celebrant and those by the congregation, or by other specific persons involved in the liturgy, e. g. those marrying. With the arrival of printing, other typographic effects such as italic type, bolded type, or different sizes of type, were used to emphasize a section of text, and as printing in two colours is more expensive and time consuming, rubrication has tended to be reserved for sacred and liturgical books or luxury editions of other works. William Morris's medievally inspired typography for the Kelmscott Press at the end of the 19th century included chapter titles and other accents in red, or rarely blue, ink, and was influential on small press art typography associated with the Arts and Crafts movement in both England and the United States, particularly the work of the Ashendene, Doves, and Roycroft Presses. Around 1900, rubrication was incorporated into a Red letter edition of the King James Version of the Bible to distinguish the Dominical words, i. e., those spoken by Jesus Christ during His corporeal life on Earth, because that translation lacked quotation marks. Other versions of the Bible have since adopted the popular practice. </doc> <doc id="2341072" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341072" title="Colwyn Philipps, 3rd Viscount St Davids"> Colwyn Philipps, 3rd Viscount St Davids Colwyn Iestyn John Philipps, 3rd Viscount St Davids , (30 January 1939 – 26 April 2009), was a British businessman, Conservative politician and writer on music. Besides his viscountcy, he also held the older titles of Baron Strange of Knockin (1299), Baron Hungerford (1426), and Baron de Moleyns (1445), & the Baronetcy of Picton Castle (1621). He was also a co-heir to the barony of Grey de Ruthyn. Philipps was the son of Jestyn Philipps, 2nd Viscount St Davids and Doreen Guinness Jowett. He was educated at Dulwich College Preparatory School, Haverfordwest Grammar School, Sevenoaks School and in Melbourne, Australia. He returned to the UK to pursue his career, later studying at King's College London where he took a Certificate in Advanced Musical Studies in 1989. Philipps was a 2nd Lieutenant in the Welsh Guards before he became a partner in the London stockbroking firm of Scrimgeour Kemp-Gee, which was later absorbed by Citicorp. He had a keen interest in music, both historically and as a manuscript collector (at one point owning the largest private collection in existence). He specialized in the life and works of Rossini, contributed to "Music & Letters" (along with various other musicological works) and was the bibliographer of the Rossini Foundation in Pesaro, Italy. Lord St Davids succeeded his father in the viscountcy in 1991. He served under John Major as a Lord-in-waiting from 1992 to 1994 and was a Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords from 1995. He was the only Conservative member of the Welsh National Assembly Advisory Group, and his work in relation to Welsh devolution was described by Dafydd Elis-Thomas (Welsh Assembly Presiding Officer) as "the most significant contribution of any Welsh Conservative politician to the cause of devolution; If Ron Davies was the architect of devolution, Colwyn was his enthusiastic draughtsman. His encouragement was unstinting". As a hereditary peer, he was excluded from the House by the House of Lords Act 1999. Lord St Davids married Augusta Victoria Correa y Larraín Ugarte from Santiago, Chile in 1965. They had two children: St Davids died in April 2009, aged 70, and was succeeded by his elder son. The requiem mass held at his funeral at St. Davids Cathedral on 6 May 2009 was believed to be the first Catholic Mass to be held there since the Reformation. </doc> <doc id="2341093" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341093" title="1974 European Athletics Championships"> 1974 European Athletics Championships The 11th European Athletics Championships of 1974 were held from 2 September to 8 September in Italy, at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.

He was born in Plumbland, Cumberland, the son of Joseph Nicolson, Rector of Plumbland and educated at the school in nearby Dovenby. He went up to Queen's College, Oxford and obtained a BA in 1676, an MA in 1679 and became a Fellow, (1679–1682). After visiting Leipzig to learn German he was ordained as a deacon in 1679 and made Vicar of Torpenhow in 1681.He was also made prebendary of Carlisle Cathedral in 1681, and Archdeacon in 1682. Twenty years later he was appointed bishop of Carlisle, and he served as Lord High Almoner to George I of Great Britain from 1716-1718. He was translated to Derry in 1718. In 1727 he was nominated archbishop of Cashel and Emly, following the death on 1 January of Archbishop Palliser, but died in Derry before he could assume charge. He was buried in Derry Cathedral. He had been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in November 1705. He had married Elizabeth, daughter of John Archer of Oxenholme, near Kirby Kendal, Westmoreland. Nicolson is remembered by the impulsiveness of his temperament, which led him into a good deal of strife as a bishop; he quarreled with Hugh Todd, who ended up excommunicated. He showed real zeal in collecting and guarding manuscripts and other official documents. For this purpose he had special rooms built at Derry. His chief works were the "Historical Library" (English, 1696-97-99; Scottish, 1702; Irish, 1724; complete later editions, 1732 and 1776), and "Leges Marchiarum or Border Laws" (1705, new ed., 1747). </doc> <doc id="2341110" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341110" title="Bound &amp; Gagged"> Bound &amp; Gagged Bound & Gagged may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2341113" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341113" title="Orange Peel (event)"> Orange Peel (event) In 1995, a group of students, faculty and alumni from Oklahoma State University traveled to the University of Florida to witness its annual pep rally known as the Gator Growl," which would become the inspiration for Oklahoma State's "Orange Peel" event. A month after witnessing the Gator Growl, student leaders were selected and the planning and preparation for the first Orange Peel began. When creators contemplated on a name they decided to get away from OSU's longstanding cowboy theme and establish a unique school identity. So to honor Oklahoma State University's primary color the rally became known as "Orange Peel". After deciding on the pep rally name, the students decided to let the campus submit ideas for a mascot. From this contest, the mascot "Pulp" was born. He was to be an orange wearing a cowboy hat and boots. With a mascot and a name, the team forged ahead developing a mission statement and a set of goals. The mission was simple and ambitious: "To become the largest student-produced concert event in the country and provide the OSU family with national and local headlining entertainment." Within a few years, the event has attracted such big-name entertainers as Alan Jackson, Jason Mraz, Lit, Pablo Francisco, Incubus, Sinbad, Barenaked Ladies, Better Than Ezra, Vanessa Carlton, Third Eye Blind, Goo Goo Dolls, Blues Traveler, David Spade, Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Cosby, Damon Wayans, Randy Travis and Ben Folds. In 2006, country superstar Alan Jackson, comedian Bill Engvall, and The Hero Factor performed. Orange Peel of 2008 was held at the Gallagher Iba Arena on October 3, 2008, and featured Sugarland, Motion City Soundtrack, Kellie Pickler and Ashton Shepherd. The 2009 event featured Jimmy Fallon and Jason Aldean. As of August 1, Orange Peel for the 2007-2008 school year has been canceled. Cancelation has been attributed to the financial insolvency of past events and outstanding debt owed by the University Student Government Association to the University Student Union (Allegedly $300,000). Multiple attempts by student leaders to "bring back Orange Peel" have been dismissed by school administrators as recently as 2013. It is widely believed that the administration has little interest in brokering a payment workout given their long standing campaign to discourage events which might encourage the consumption of alcohol. </doc> <doc id="2341114" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341114" title="Bowers &amp; Wilkins"> Bowers &amp; Wilkins Bowers & Wilkins, or B&W, is a British company that produces audio equipment, most notably loudspeakers. B&W was founded in 1966 by John Bowers at Worthing, West Sussex, England. Currently, B&W, while still based in Worthing, is part of the B&W Group Ltd., which also includes audio equipment manufacturers Rotel and Classé. B&W previously offered a range of electronics, such as amplifiers, under the Aura brand, but it was discontinued in 1997. Other sub-brands were 'John Bowers' for the Active One loudspeaker and preamp and 'Rock Solid' for a lifestyle speaker range. The B&W 'Blue Room' brand for 'Pod' speakers disappeared as these are currently produced and sold by Scandyna. From 1988 to 1996 B&W ran their own record label. Research and development has been a core activity within B&W, stimulated and exercised by its founder John Bowers (1922–1987). From the start of the company, earnings were invested in new product development. In 1982 the company opened a dedicated, purpose-built research centre titled 'SRE' or 'Steyning Research Establishment' in Steyning, about 10 miles from Worthing. The buildings were fit for audio-related work since they were previously used by SME, the English tonearm designer who felt the downturn in tonearm sales due to the introduction of the new digital media CD. SRE housed a prototype shop and listening rooms, ranging from semi-anechoic to typical small living rooms. Also available was advanced equipment like a laser interferometer and PDP-11/35 computer. Approximately twenty staff support the research facility. Engineers of note who have worked there in R&D include Ray Greenwood, Dr. Steve Roe, Dr. John Dibb, Dr. Glyn Adams, Dr. Peter Fryer and Laurence Dickie. The design of B&W loudspeaker cabinets has been done by industrial designer Kenneth Grange since 1975. Morten Villiers Warren became manager of design in the late 90's when designing the new 800 series of speakers. Noteworthy loudspeaker innovations by B&W: B&W offer a full range of speakers and home audio systems including the Nautilus speakers and Panorama home theatre systems. The Bowers & Wilkins Zeppelin iPod speaker system incorporates Apple's wireless AirPlay system and the range also features MM1 range to connect to either desktop pcs or laptops. Bowers & Wilkins have a range of high quality headphones and earphones. Since 2007 Bowers & Wilkins have been in partnership with Jaguar to develop in-car audio systems for cars in their range, including the XJ, XK and XF. Bowers & Wilkins currently works with Maserati and provides the sound for their Quattroporte and new Ghibli. Bowers & Wilkins also partnered with Volvo to develop an optional premium in-car audio system for the new 2016 Volvo XC90. A Bowers & Wilkins sound system is also present in the G11 BMW 7 series. Bowers & Wilkins began as a radio and electronics shop in Worthing. It was started after World War II by Bowers and Roy Wilkins who had met while serving in the Royal Corps of Signals during the war. The shop expanded to include televisions retail, a rentals business and a service department run by Peter Hayward. When the shop began supplying public address equipment to schools and churches in Sussex, Bowers became increasingly involved in the design and assembly of loudspeakers, eventually setting up a small production line in workshops behind the shop. In 1966, Bowers started a separate business – B&W Loudspeakers Ltd. and was no longer involved with the shop itself. The first production line was established in the workshops in the shop's backyard. The shop still exists to this day, and the remnants of the original production line can still be seen. The shop is now owned by and managed by Roy's son Paul Wilkins, who together with Chris Hugill used to run the UK distribution arm of B&W, B&W Loudspeakers UK Ltd. They also acted as the UK distribution of the aforementioned Aura range of electronics, and Nakamichi, regarded as the worlds foremost manufacturer of compact cassette decks and associated electronics. The 1967 P1 was the first commercial speaker from B&W. The cabinet and filter were B&W's own, but the drivers came from EMI and Celestion. The profits of the P1 allowed Bowers to purchase a Radiometer Oscillator and Pen Recorder, allowing for calibration certificates for every speaker sold. In 1968, Audioscript in the Netherlands became the first international distributor appointed. The DM1 (Domestic Monitor) and DM3 are introduced. Dennis Ward (a former technical manager at EMI) became member of the board in 1969. In 1970, the ionovac-tweeter equipped P2 speakers produced were licensed by Sony, produced in Worthing to be distributed in Japan. Bowers decided to develop a loudspeaker wholly built in-house. The sizeable DM70 from 1970 combined electrostatic mid- and high range on top of a traditional bass unit. The distinct shape of the loudspeaker won a British Industrial Design Award. Good press reviews made exports starting to rise. In 1972 a new production facility was opened in Meadow Road, Worthing. Housing anechoic chambers and extensive Bruel & Kjaer measurement equipment, the research team investigated phase linearity and speaker cone construction using laser interferometry. 1972 also saw the introduction of the DM2, a three unit system, comprising an 8 inch bass/mid-range speaker rear loaded with an acoustic line, a Celestion HF1300 tweeter and a super tweeter. B&W received the Queen's Award for Export in 1973, and built programme content monitors for the BBC. In 1974, Grange was appointed as industrial designer. The 1976 DM6 loudspeaker introduced Kevlar cones and phase linear filter and enclosure design. The Steyning research facility is opened and a PDP11/35 computer is acquired. The 1977 DM7 showed a tweeter separate from the main cabinet and a passive radiator. After a tenfold increase in export since 1973, the second Queen's Award for Export is awarded in 1978. The 801 loudspeaker, taking three years of development, was introduced in 1979. Research into amplifiers and active filters leads to the Active One loudspeaker, branded under the name of "John Bowers" in 1984. The 800 loudspeaker range was improved into matrix versions with a very rigid cabinet construction in 1987. In December 1987 Bowers died. In the same year, John Dibb joined the company, later to become responsible for many speaker designs, notably several signature models. The 1987 'Concept 90' CM1 loudspeaker was the first B&W speaker with a plastic matrix cabinet. Silver Signature loudspeaker was launched to commemorate the company's 25th anniversary. Increasing demand led to by opening an additional production site at Silverdale, Worthing, West Sussex in 1992. The 1993 'Nautilus' speaker still remains the company's flagship product. In 1998, Nautilus technology was introduced in the somewhat more affordable Nautilus 800 series. In 2002 B&W moved its Worthing production, warehousing and head office to a new £7 million location on a former landfill site in Dale Road, Worthing. A second plant was built in Bradford. B&W took over its own production factory for cabinets Agerbæk, Denmark in 2003. In the same year, the Bradford location was left for new premises in Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire. In 2005, Bowers & Wilkins replaced its top-of-the-line N800 range with the new 800D range. The most publicised change was the introduction of diamond dome tweeters on some models 2005 also saw B&W receive the Queen's Award for Innovation for the tube-loaded drivers on the 800's. The EISA Award for European High End Audio Component of the Year is awarded to the 803D. The PV1 receives the European Home Theatre Subwoofer of the year 2005–2006 award. The XT series introduced aluminium as a speaker cabinet material. In 2007 the 'Zeppelin' iPod speaker system was introduced. In 2008, the "Jaguar XF Audio System" was introduced, a car audio setup with 14 speakers and a powered 440 Watt Class AB DSP amplifier. Bowers & Wilkins' latest project is the Society of Sound. Launched in June 2007, it is an online community focused on issues and discussions relating to high quality sound. The Society of Sound has a number of celebrity "Fellows", who contribute material. Fellows include Peter Gabriel, film composer James Howard, musician Dave Stewart, jazz singer Cassandra Wilson and industrial designer Kenneth Grange. In May 2008, Bowers and Wilkins started the Bowers & Wilkins Music Club – now known simply as Society of Sound, returning the company into the music business. The Society of Sound is a subscription-based music retail site. Albums are currently available in either Apple Lossless or Flac format. The site is a partnership with Peter Gabriel's Real World Studios, and artists to be featured have been Little Axe, Cara Dillon, Gwyneth Herbert and Portico Quartet. Former Suede frontman Brett Anderson had his solo album Wilderness released through the Society of Sound before being available for retail. In 2010,the 800 Series Diamond D2 line, the P5 Mobile Hi-Fi on-ear headphones and the MM-1 computer speakers were released. On 5 January 2011, Bowers & Wilkins announced the Zeppelin Air, their first speaker to include Apple AirPlay to make it into a wireless iPod speaker. For the 2010 season, they sponsored the FAZZT Racing #77 of Alex Tagliani in the IZOD IndyCar Series, which became the Sam Schmidt Motorsports entry for 2011, winning the pole position at the Indianapolis 500. Because of a 2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway promotion, Tagliani was temporarily replaced for the Kentucky Indy 300 by Dan Wheldon, who would be killed at Las Vegas in the car Tagliani put on the pole at Indianapolis, while Tagliani was driving for Las Vegas the No. 98 William Rast Bryan Herta Autosport car that was another Schmidt-prepared car. June 2011 saw the launch of the C5 earphones and in May 2012 Bowers & Wilkins launched their P3 headphones at Abbey Road Studios, London. In March 2013 they launched their Z2 wireless speaker system as a sister product to the Zeppelin. In September 2013, B&W introduced the P7 over-ear headphones. In 2014, B&W partnered with the automobile company Volvo to have their in-car audio systems featured in the all new Volvo XC90. In September 2014, B&W released the updated P5 Series 2 on-ear headphones and C5 Series 2 in-ear headphones. In October 2014, B&W introduced the T7 wireless speaker, being their first portable Bluetooth speaker. In July 2015, B&W introduced the P5 Wireless on-ear headphones, their first portable Bluetooth headphone. In September 2015, B&W released the 800 Series Diamond D3 line. This line abandons the traditional Kevlar in favour of a new "Continuum Cone" made of a composite material. Other new technologies include a new bass driver made of Aerofoil with variable thickness and the new Turbine Head, built from solid aluminium. The Diamond tweeters remain. The initial release includes the 802 D3, 803 D3, 804 D3, 805 D3, HTM1 D3 and HTM2 D3. Release of the 800 D3 is expected in coming months. In May 2016 it was announced that EVA Automation, based in California had acquired Bowers & Wilkins for an undisclosed amount. Previous share holders Caledonia were to sell their stake in the company. </doc> <doc id="2341121" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341121" title="Nocera Umbra"> Nocera Umbra Nocera Umbra is a town and "comune" in the province of Perugia, Italy, 15 kilometers north of Foligno, at an altitude of 520 m above sea-level. The "comune", covering an area of 157.19 km², is one of the largest in Umbria. The town of Nocera was founded in the 7th century BC by inhabitants from Camerinum, an Umbrian town, who left their ancestral homeland during a so-called ver sacrum (sacred spring). The name Nocera in the Osco-Umbrian language was "Noukria", meaning "New" (town). The Roman town was not located on the hill - where modern Nocera lies - but in the valley, near the Topino creek. The town - with the Latin name Nuceria Camellana – came under Roman control between the end of the 4th century and the first decades of the 3rd century BC, and became a Municipium. It soon acquired strategic importance because it lay on a branch of the via Flaminia, the road which linked Rome to the Adriatic, going from "Forum Flamini" (S. Giovanni Profiamma, near Foligno) to "Fanum", on the Picenum. Several remains of the Roman roads are still visible today. From Nuceria the Romans also built another road – the "Septempedana" - leading to the Roman military outposts of "Prolaqueum" and "Septempeda", on the Adriatic side of the Apennines. According to Pliny the Elder, Nuceria was inhabited by two tribes, one the "Nucerini Favonienses" (faithful of "Favonia", also named Fauna, a Goddess) and the other "Camellani" (originating from "Camerinum", or possibly makers of "camellae", small wooden containers). Strabo records that the town was famous for the production of wooden vases (possibly barrels). During the second Punic war, in 217 BC, Hannibal, on his way to the Adriatic after the battle of Trasimeno, is said to have camped with his army near the town (in a place still known as "Affrica"). Near Nuceria, on the shores of what is now the dried up "Lacus Plestinus", the commander of the Roman cavalry, Gaius Centenius, fought a battle with 4,000 knights against Carthaginian troops headed by Maharbal. The town reached the height of its prosperity during the first two centuries AD. During the 5th century, the diocese of Nocera was formed. The Roman town was destroyed at the beginning of the 5th century, possibly by the Visigoths: the survivors rebuilt their homes on top of the hill, where today's Nocera still stands. The Lombards occupied the town and stationed an Arimannia there, then a Gastaldatus and finally, at the beginning of the 9th century (during the Frankish period) it became a county. The walled town – it was named "arx fortissima" in contemporary documents - guarded the northern border of the Duchy of Spoleto against the Byzantine garrison at Gualdo Tadino. The importance of Nocera during the Lombard period is underlined by the Necropolis excavated in 1897, whose artefacts – weapons, jewels, household utensils, ceramics - form the core of the Museo dell'alto Medioevo in Rome. During the Middle Ages Nocera became a walled town, very much as it exists today. In 1202 the town came under the control of Perugia, and in 1248 it was destroyed by emperor Frederick II. Shortly thereafter it came into the possession of the Trinci of Foligno. In 1421 the Castellan of Nocera, Pietro di Rasiglia, suspecting his wife of adultery with Niccolò I Trinci, invited the whole Trinci family to a hunting party and had them all killed, except the young Corrado, who took revenge for the murder of his relatives, attacking the town and killing the treacherous castellan. In 1439 Cardinal Giovanni Vitelleschi crushed the Trinci's Signoria, and Nocera was annexed to the Papal States. The town, with the exception of the Napoleonic period, remained under papal control until 1860 when, as a part of Umbria, it was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. The town and the surrounding hamlets have been struck several times by earthquakes. The major ones took place on April 30, 1279, April 17, 1747, and September 26, 1997. The damage caused by the last of these has not yet (2014) been fully repaired. It has some old churches, containing pictures and frescoes; in the Cathedral is a large altarpiece by Niccolò Alunno. Six kilometers south-east of the town ("frazione" of Bagni) is the "Angelica" mineral spring. The principal mountain is the Monte Pennino with an altitude of 1,575 m.

Quarry-working here ceased in 1934, and the site has since been colonised by vegetation. The underlying rock is magnesian limestone and this has had a strong influence in determining the range of plant and animal communities now found there. In 1968 the quarry was designated as a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The SSSI boundaries were revised in 1982 to exclude areas which were no longer found to have high wildlife interest due to tipping and quarry reworking. The site contains a variety of vegetation types including woodland, scrub, and several grassland communities. The most important part of the site from a biodiversity conservation perspective is the species-rich unimproved magnesian limestone grassland, which covers just under of the site. Only of this habitat exist in Britain, two-thirds of it in County Durham. Magnesian limestone grassland supports an assemblage of calcicolous plants adapted to growing in thin soils with a short sward. The quarry holds one of the largest British populations of the dark red helleborine, "Epipactis atrorubens"; a survey in 2010 found nearly 1700 flowering spikes of this nationally rare species. The quarry is a breeding site for the Durham argus butterfly, a local race of the brown argus found only in northeast England. The site attracted the interest of birdwatchers in 2002 when a pair of European bee-eaters took up residence, raising two young, only the third breeding attempt ever in Britain. Bishop Middleham Quarry is managed as a Nature Reserve by the Durham Wildlife Trust. The last time the site was assessed by Natural England, in June 2009, it was given a "favourable" rating. </doc> <doc id="2341134" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341134" title="Robert Ardrey"> Robert Ardrey Robert Ardrey (October 16, 1908 – January 14, 1980) was an American playwright, screenwriter and science writer perhaps best known for "The Territorial Imperative" (1966). After a Broadway and Hollywood career, he returned to his academic training in anthropology and the behavioral sciences in the 1950s. As a playwright and screenwriter Ardrey received many accolades. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1937, won the inaugural Sidney Howard Memorial Award in 1940, and in 1966 received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay for his script for "Khartoum". His most famous play, "Thunder Rock", is widely considered an international classic. Ardrey's scientific work played a major role in overturning long-standing assumptions in the social sciences. In particular, both "African Genesis" (1961) and "The Territorial Imperative" (1966), two of his most widely read works, were instrumental in changing scientific doctrine and increasing public awareness of evolutionary science. His work was so popular that many prominent scientists cite it as inspiring them to enter their fields. Robert Ardrey was born in Chicago, the son of Robert Leslie Ardrey, an editor and publisher, and Marie (née Haswell). His father died in 1919 from pneumonia during the influenza epidemic and he was raised by his mother. He grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended the nearby University of Chicago, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1930 as a Ph.B. While in attendance, he studied creative writing with Thornton Wilder, who would become his lifelong mentor. His first play, "Star Spangled", opened on Broadway in 1935 and lasted only a few days, but resulted in the award of a Guggenheim Fellowship. The award granted Ardrey the financial independence to focus on writing plays. Several of his subsequent plays, including "Casey Jones", "How to Get Tough About It", and his most famous play, "Thunder Rock", were produced on Broadway. In 1938 he moved to Hollywood to work as a screenwriter for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where he would eventually become MGM's highest paid writer. There he wrote many screenplays, including those for adaptations such as "The Three Musketeers" (1948, with Gene Kelly), "Madame Bovary" (1949), "The Secret Garden" (1949), and "The Wonderful Country" (1959, with Robert Mitchum; "The Wonderful Country" also had a cameo from famed Negro Leagues pitcher Satchel Paige). He also wrote original screenplays, including the screenplay for "Khartoum" (1966, directed by Basil Dearden, starring Charlton Heston and Laurence Olivier) for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Story, and Screenplay. During the 1950s Ardrey became increasingly disenchanted with Hollywood and what he saw as the growing role money had started to play in creative decisions. At the same time and largely by accident, he renewed his interest in human origins and human behavior, which he had studied at the University of Chicago. In the summer of 1956 he moved with his wife and two sons to Geneva. He spent the following years traveling in Southern and Eastern Africa, conducting research for what was to become his first book on the subject, "African Genesis" (1961), ultimately an international bestseller. Subsequently, he went on to write a total of four books in his widely read "Nature of Man Series", including his best known book "The Territorial Imperative" (1966). In October 1960 he moved with his second wife to Trastevere, Rome, where they lived for 17 years. In 1977 they moved to a small town named Kalk Bay just outside Cape Town, South Africa. He continued to publish influential works until his death on January 14, 1980. His ashes, along with those of his wife, are interred in the Holy Trinity Church overlooking False Bay. After graduating from the University of Chicago, under the continuing mentorship of Thornton Wilder, Ardrey wrote a novel, several plays, and many short stories, all of which remained unpublished. It was Wilder's rule that "A young author should not write for market until his style [has] 'crystallized'". Wilder and Ardrey agreed that this moment came with the writing of the play "Star Spangled". "Star Spangled" opened on Broadway in 1935. It was a comedy that brought to life the classic struggles of an immigrant family living on the South Side of Chicago. It received largely negative reviews and lasted only a few days. However it did catch the attention of notable playwright Sidney Howard, whom Ardrey claims was instrumental in the resulting award of a Guggenheim fellowship for promise as a young playwright. The award allowed Ardrey the financial independence to remain in Chicago and focus on writing plays. While in Chicago Ardrey wrote two more plays. The first, "Casey Jones", was a play about railroad men and their love for their machines. The second, "How to Get Tough About It", Ardrey describes as "A proletarian love story of pleasant dimensions." In 1938 Guthrie McClintic presented "How to Get Tough About It" and Elia Kazan directed "Casey Jones". The plays opened ten days apart and were massive failures. In his preface to "Plays of Three Decades" Ardrey writes: No author in Broadway memory had attained two such failures on a scale quite so grand on evenings quite so close together. Had they opened six months apart, none would have noticed. Coming as they did, I became a kind of upside-down white-headed boy, a figure thundering toward literary glory in reverse gear. Hollywood, incapable of resisting the colossal, bid lavishly for my services. And Samuel Goldwyn, buyer of none but the best, bought me. Ardrey signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and moved for the first time to Hollywood to work as a screenwriter. He worked on several projects, including Samuel Goldwyn's notorious boondoggle remake of "Graustark", which was cancelled, and a western called "The Cowboy and the Lady", from which he was dropped (though he later used most of the plot for his smash success "Lady Takes A Chance"). While in Los Angeles he would meet and work with Samuel Goldwyn, Clarence Brown, Pandro Berman, Garson Kanin, Gene Fowler, Lillian Hellman, Sidney Howard, and S.N. Behrman. Robert Ardrey wrote "Thunder Rock" during the period of escalation in Europe which would lead to World War II. Despairing of the growing isolationism among Americans, Ardrey became convinced that American involvement in the war was a moral necessity. However he did not intend to write a play about the conflict until he was struck by a moment of inspiration during a performance of "Swan Lake", in which he conceived of "the play from beginning to end, complete with first, second, and third act curtains." "The theatre… did a great deal to keep the morale of the British people high. One intellectual play had an enormous effect in keeping alight a spirit of hope at a time when it was nearer to extinction than it had ever been, either before or after. This was "Thunder Rock", by Robert Ardrey. What he accomplished for the British people at a moment of supreme despair… merits their lasting gratitude. … He, more quietly but equally effectively as Churchill, urged us never to surrender." Following its success in London, "Thunder Rock" has had a lasting legacy. Later in 1940 the BBC broadcast a live radio version, and in 1946 they produced an adaption for television. In 1942, "Thunder Rock" was turned into a film, directed by the Boulting Brothers, also starring Michael Redgrave. ("See Thunder Rock (film)") Shortly following the war, productions of "Thunder Rock" were quickly launched in Vienna, Prague, Budapest, and, most famously, in Allied-occupied Berlin where it was the first modern play to go up in the American zone. It continues to be commonly produced in American university theaters and productions have gone up all around the globe, including in Harare (formerly Salisbury), Zimbabwe, and Nairobi, Kenya. After "Thunder Rock" quickly closed on Broadway, Ardrey returned to Hollywood. His first official credit was the screenplay for the adaptation of Sidney Howard's Pulitzer Prize-winning play "They Knew What They Wanted (1939)". It was directed by Garson Kanin, starred Carole Lombard and Charles Laughton, and was shot on location in Napa Valley. Following these successes in Hollywood, Ardrey returned to New York to reengage the theater. There he wrote "Jeb". "Jeb" was a play about a disabled African American soldier returning to his home in the rural south after having fought in the war in the Pacific. He has lost one leg, but gained the ability to run an adding machine. Seeking out employment, he is faced with the bigotry of his countrymen. "Jeb" opened in New York in 1946. It received largely positive reviews (famed American theatre critic George Jean Nathan called it the best play on the topic of civil rights) and found small but enthusiastic audiences. However, due to factors including high production costs and relatively low revenues, the play had to close after a run of only one week. The critical consensus, with which Ardrey came to agree, was that "Jeb" was far ahead of its time. Following the short run of "Jeb" Ardrey moved back to Hollywood and signed a two-picture deal with MGM. In 1946 and '47 he wrote "The Secret Garden". In 1947 he wrote the screenplay for "The Three Musketeers", (which would become the second-highest-grossing film of 1948.) starring Lana Turner and Gene Kelly. This became Gene Kelly's favorite non-musical role. In 1949, Ardrey wrote the screenplay for Gustave Flaubert's classic novel Madame Bovary. The film starred Jennifer Jones with James Mason playing the role of Flaubert. The novel was originally tried for obscenity in France and Ardrey used this as a device to frame the story and allow for a commentator. In 1947, Ardrey, amid growing persecution of Hollywood by the House Un-American Activities Committee, was elected to the board of the Screen Writers Guild and made chairman of its Political Advisory Committee. Following the foundation of the Committee for the First Amendment, Ardrey flew to Washington, along with Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Gene Kelly, Danny Kaye, and John Huston to defend The Hollywood Ten. Later, on behalf of the Guild, Ardrey worked with Thurman Arnold to lodge a suit against the blacklist with the Supreme Court. The suit came up for review four years later, but the Guild dropped it. In the early '50s, partly due to its enforcement of the blacklists and partly due to the increasing role banks were playing in creative decisions, Ardrey began to feel a growing dissatisfaction with Hollywood and started to travel abroad. He travelled to Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, the Riviera, Venice, Yugoslavia, where he spent a month living in Belgrade, Greece, Istanbul, and Munich. He later described these travels as "necessary exercises" for his book "African Genesis." In 1952 Ardrey joined the Adlai Stevenson campaign against Richard Nixon as a part of the group "Hollywood for Stevenson". The group sponsored an investigator to go to Nixon's hometown for research. While there he discovered, in the high school newspaper archives, that Richard Nixon had been known as Tricky Dick. In 1954 Ardrey wrote a play about the persecution of accused communists in post-Cold War America. This play, Sing Me No Lullaby, was presented at the Phoenix Theatre in London. Brooks Atkinson, in his New York Times review, wrote "the contribution [Ardrey] has made in the last act is a clear and perceptive statement of this nameless, formless situation and an estimation of what it is doing to America…Mr. Ardrey…is a man of principle and taste. In "Sing Me No Lullaby" he has performed the function of a writer. He has found the words to describe something that is vague and elusive but ominous. And he has got far enough away from political recriminations to state it in terms of character and the life of the spirit." Also in 1954 Ardrey wrote the adaptation of John Masters' novel "Bhowani Junction". Due in part to the intervention of the banks financing the film, Ardrey entered into contested negotiations over rewrites. Eventually he quit and took his name off the film. In 1958 Ardrey wrote the play "Shadow of Heroes" about the Hungarian Uprising of 1956. The play resulted in the release from Soviet custody of two political prisoners, Julia Rajk and her son. Ardrey next turned his attention toward Africa. He was soon to begin his pioneering work in paleoanthropology, but he also continued his career as a screenwriter. In 1964 he wrote the first screenplay adaptation of Isak Dinesen's novel "Out of Africa". In 1966 he wrote another screenplay set in Africa, the Academy Award-nominated "Khartoum". "Khartoum" was written and produced in 1966, directed by Basil Dearden. The film is based on historical accounts of British Gen. Charles "Chinese" Gordon's defense of the Sudanese city of Khartoum from the forces of the Mahdist army during the Siege of Khartoum. "Khartoum" starred Charlton Heston as General Gordon and Laurence Olivier as the Mahdi (Muhammad Ahmed). Heston, in his autobiography, wrote about his decision to take the role: "It's a good part, presents the challenge of doing a mystic, as well as the English thing. Also, it's a helluva good script." The Academy agreed with Heston's assessment of the script. In 1967 "Khartoum" earned Ardrey a nomination for the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Ardrey died, aged 71, in South Africa. In 1955, when Ardrey was considering a trip to Africa, Max Ascoli, publisher of "The Reporter", offered to buy anything that Ardrey would write there. At the same time, Ardrey renewed an acquaintance with prominent geologist Richard Foster Flint. Because of Ardrey's background in geology and paleontology, Flint arranged for Ardrey to investigate claims made by Raymond Dart about a specimen of "Australopithecus africanus". Ardrey met Dart in South Africa and examined his evidence. Particularly, Dart had amassed a sample of 5,000 fossils from the Makapan cave. Among the fossils, some bones that could be used as tools—the lower jaw bones of small gazelles, which could be used as cutting tools, and the humerus of antelope, which could be used as clubs—were overrepresented (more frequent) by a factor of ten. This led Dart to theorize that in australopithecines, as man's direct ancestors, the use of weapons evolutionarily predated the development of large brains. Ardrey wrote an article about Dart's theory for "The Reporter." After receiving significant attention, it was reprinted in "Science Digest" and led to The Smithsonian Institution contacting Dart. This trip would serve as the beginning of Ardrey's renewed interest in the human sciences and the initiation of his groundbreaking work in paleoanthropology. Ardrey spent the latter part of his life working as a scientist and science writer. (In 1969 he was also contracted by Universal to write a screenplay of Baroness Karen Blixen's memoir Out of Africa, but it was never produced.) While this scientific work at first appears disparate with his early career, later commentators have emphasized the continuity. In his "New York Times" obituary, Bayard Webster wrote, "A closer look at his dramas and his behavioral books disclose that he was writing about social conditions in both genres. One involved humans, the other concerned both humans and other animals. But the dramatic theme was the same: the difficulties humans and other animals have in dealing with each other, and the reasons for their actions." Both the scientific content as well as the writing of Ardrey's work was widely praised. The famed biologist and naturalist E. O. Wilson was one notable supporter of Ardrey's work. Upon the publication of "The Hunting Hypothesis" he wrote: In his excellent new book Robert Ardrey continues as the lyric poet of human evolution, capturing the Homeric quality of the subject that so many scientists by and large feel but are unable to put into words. His opinions, like those in his earlier works, are controversial but more open, squarely stated, and closer to the truth than the protests of his most scandalized critics. In his 1964 book "The Analysis of Prose", William D. Templeman used African Genesis as his third lesson. The volume included analysis and questions from his students at the University of Southern California. A.J. Jacobs, who wrote the 2004 book The Know-It-All, about reading the entire Encyclopædia Britannica, asserts that a quote from African Genesis was the most profound thing he read while reading the Encyclopædia. Ardrey wrote for both popular and technical publications, but his scientific writing was mostly intended for the informed non-specialist reader in paleoanthropology, which encompasses anthropology, ethology, paleontology, zoology and human evolution. He was widely praised for crossing the boundaries of scientific specialism. "The Observer", for instance, in its review of "The Social Contract", wrote that "Robert Ardrey ... leaps across the fences with which scientists nowadays surround their special subjects. He reports their findings in clear English. He attempts to relate them in a single science of Man, by which all of us may try to know ourselves." This single "science of Man" was postulated in Ardrey's influential Nature of Man Series, which is composed of four books: "African Genesis: A Personal Investigation into the Animal Origins and Nature of Man" (1961), "The Territorial Imperative: A Personal Inquiry Into the Animal Origins of Property and Nations" (1966), "The Social Contract: A Personal Inquiry into the Evolutionary Sources of Order and Disorder" (1970), and "The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man" (1976). Along with Raymond Dart and Konrad Lorenz, Robert Ardrey became one of the three most famous proponents of the hunting hypothesis and the killer ape theory. Ardrey postulated that precursors of "Australopithecus" survived millions of years of drought in the Miocene and Pliocene epochs, as the savannah spread and the forests shrank, by adapting the hunting ways of carnivorous species. Changes in survival techniques and social organization gradually differentiated pre-humans from other primates. Concomitant changes in diet potentiated unique developments in the human brain. The killer ape theory posits that aggression, a vital factor in hunting prey for food, was a fundamental characteristic which distinguished prehuman ancestors from other primates. Ardrey also argued that aggression was therefore an inherited evolutionary trait still present in man. He challenged the reigning blank-slate hypothesis (similarly aligned with cultural determinism), then in currency among social scientists. The blank-slate hypothesis was famously defended (and Ardrey was famously attacked) by Ashley Montagu. This debate sparked a major controversy in anthropology and led to widespread popular interest in human origins. It also captured the popular attention and led to increased public interest in human origins. Ardrey's ideas notably influenced Sam Peckinpah, to whom Strother Martin gave copies of two of Ardrey's books, as well as Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick in the development of "". More recently, according to archeology expert K. Kris Hirst, reviewing the "Dawn of Humanity" (2015 PBS film) documentary which describes, directly in the context of "2001", the 2015 studies of fossils of "Homo naledi", the behavior of apes in the "Dawn of Man" sequence of "2001" have been "proven false", since contemporary evidence suggests that such supposedly violent apes were in fact vegetarians. Though some of Ardrey's theses on aggression have been contradicted, his popularization of the theory of African Genesis (as opposed to European or Asian Genesis) remains a major turning point in understanding the dawn of humanity. These themes have also been investigated in academia by, among others: Some of the scientists whose research particularly informed Robert Ardrey's scientific investigations, and with several of whom Ardrey consulted at length while developing his four major works in Africa from the 1940s through the 1970s, include: Fiction Nonfiction There are a number of university libraries that house Robert Ardrey's papers. The primary archive for the Robert Ardrey Collection is at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center in the Mugar Memorial Library at Boston University. There are also additional collections of Robert Ardrey's works held at UCLA, Rutgers, and the University of Chicago.

Diadora is an Italian athletic footwear and apparel manufacturer, a tradition that began in 1948 when the company's founder, Marcello Danieli, first began working in the trade as a young boy. He called his company "Diadora" a name suggested by a friend. In Greek, "dia dora" means "by means of gifts" which was appropriate, but probably not the origin of his friend's suggestion. More likely, it came from the name given by the Greeks of Byzantium to the Dalmatian town of Zadar. Originally called "de ladera" or "from Zadar," it was mistakenly copied and translated from Dalmatian to Latin, becoming, along the way "Diadora." Danieli, helped by his wife, managed to successfully launch his first product, mountain climbing boots. During the 1950s, a reputation for excellence and quality helped the company grow and become a familiar name throughout the Italian market. During the economic boom of the 1960s, people began to enjoy prosperity and increased recreation. Skiing became popular and Danieli once again met the needs of the market by manufacturing ski boots and the first apres-ski boots. Next, Diadora introduced running shoes and shortly thereafter, tennis shoes. With the 1970s came a young generation whose explosive interest in athletics initiated a boom in the sporting goods industry. Based originally on the renowned Italian artisan techniques, Diadora's shoes became more and more technologically advanced, thanks to cooperation from champions such as Guillermo Vilas, Martin Mulligan and Björn Borg. The mid-'70s also marked Diadora's entry into the football category, aided by Roberto Bettega, who both provided invaluable consulting information. Diadora America is the #3 brand in the market share in football (soccer). AC Milan striker Marco van Basten became the face of the company in the late 1980s, and launched his own personalized football boots, the San Siro Van Basten. Diadora had and currently have a number of other high-profile football players under their sponsorship such as; George Weah, Roberto Baggio, Giuseppe Signori, Francesco Totti, Roy Keane and Antonio Cassano. On 30 June 1998, Invicta, an outdoor athletics equipment company, was acquired by Diadora. In 2007, Diadora signed a contract with football club NK Dinamo Zagreb, Croatia. Sheffield Wednesday F.C. wore kits for several seasons in the mid 2000s. Maccabi Netanya and Beitar Jerusalem also wore kits for several seasons in the mid to late 2000s. In 2016, Diadora signed contracts with FK Željezničar and Collingwood Magpies Netball. In 2008, Diadora SpA signed a joint venture with Win Hanverky Holdings Limited forming a new company called Winor International Company Limited that owns the trademark "DIADORA" in China, Hong Kong, and Macau and will manufacture, design, promote, distribute, and sell products bearing the "DIADORA" in those countries. In June 2009, Diadora reached an agreement with Italian shoe-making company Geox's founder and chairman Mario Moretti Polegato to buy its assets through his family's investment arm, LIR. </doc> <doc id="2341147" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341147" title="CLASS"> CLASS CLASS may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2341155" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341155" title="Black House (Church of Satan)"> Black House (Church of Satan) The Black House was a building that formerly stood at 6114 California St. in San Francisco, California, in the United States. The house was used by Anton LaVey as the headquarters of his Church of Satan from 1966 until his death in 1997. LaVey conducted Satanic seminars and rituals at the house; one of the most notorious such rituals was the Satanic baptism of his daughter Zeena Schreck in 1967, punctuated by LaVey speaking the words "Hail Zeena! Hail Satan!" over the nude body of a female acting as the 'Satanic Altar'. Public ceremonies were performed at the house until 1972. LaVey lost ownership of the house in 1991 as the result of a court settlement resulting from his separation from Diane Hegarty, but LaVey was allowed to reside at the Black House until his death. Following LaVey's death, members of the Church of Satan unsuccessfully attempted to raise funds to repurchase the house, and it was demolished on October 17, 2001. A duplex now stands in its place. Though the building is sometimes referred to as a mansion, photographs of the building taken just before its destruction show that it was a moderately sized single family home, considerably smaller than the two small apartment buildings on either side of the property.

They are extended in all of Argentina except for the Province of Buenos Aires and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires, the national capital, each of which has different administrative arrangements (respectively "partidos" and "comunas"). Except in La Rioja, Mendoza, and San Juan Provinces, departments have no executive authorities or assemblies of their own. However, they serve as territorial constituencies for the election of members of the legislative bodies of most provinces. For example, in Santa Fe Province, each department returns one senator to the provincial senate. In Tucumán Province, on the other hand, where legislators are elected by zone (Capital, East, West) the departments serve only as districts for the organization of certain civil agencies, such as the police or the health system. There are 376 departments in all, not including the two "nominal" departments composed of internationally disputed territory in Tierra del Fuego Province: "Antártida Argentina", and "Islas del Atlántico Sur" (which includes the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands). Of the department names, 31 are not unique within Argentina, with the result that 90 departments have identically or similarly named counterparts in one or more other Argentine province.

In the period before the Roman supremacy in southern Italy, Nuceria Alfaterna, situated between the current Nocera Inferiore and Nocera Superiore, appears to have been the chief town in the valley of the river Sarnus, with Herculaneum, Pompeii, Stabiae and Surrentum all being dependent upon it. Nuceria minted its own money, its coins bearing the head of the "river god", and developed its own alphabet called "nucerino" which derived from the Etruscan language. It maintained its allegiance to Rome until 309 BC when it joined the revolted Samnites. In 308 BC, it repulsed a Roman attempt to land at the mouth of the Sarnus, but in 307 BC, it was besieged and surrendered. It obtained favourable terms, and remained faithful to Rome even after Cannae. Hannibal reduced it in 216 BC by starvation, and destroyed the town. The inhabitants returned when peace was restored. Even during the Social War, Nuceria remained true to Rome, though the dependent towns joined the revolt; after it they were formed into independent communities, and Nuceria received the territory of Stabiae, which had been destroyed by Sulla in 89 BC, as a compensation. In 73 BC it was plundered by Spartacus. At an early date, the city became an episcopal see, and in the 12th century, it sided with Innocent II against Roger of Sicily, suffering severely for its choice. In the 13th century, and long after, the town had the name of "Nocera de' Pagani" (Nocera of the pagans) because a colony of Muslim Saracens was introduced by Frederick II. The town was described as "a genuine Muhammadan town with all its characteristic mosques and minarets." It is said that, through their darker complexion and features, the townsfolk maintain the heritage of these Muslims settlers. Notably, while the towns name was changed from "Nocera de' Pagani" to "Nocera Inferiore", a nearby town, "Nuceria Christianorum", was renamed Nocera Superiore. A small colony of Saracens was actually introduced in the town around the 9th century. By the end of the 15th century, until 1806 had the epithet ("of the pagans", "Nuceria Paganorum"). Today there is the town of Pagani, which lies about one 1.5 km to the west. In 1385 Pope Urban VI was besieged in the castle by Charles III of Naples. Helena, the widow of Manfred of Sicily, was imprisoned in the Castle and died here after the battle of Benevento (1268). Here also Urban VI imprisoned the cardinals who favoured the antipope Clement VII. The castle also had as guests the writers Dante Alighieri and Boccaccio. About three kilometers to the east, near the village of Nocera Superiore, is the circular church of "Santa Maria Maggiore", dating from the 6th century. Its chief feature is its dome, ceiled with stone internally, but covered externally with a false roof. It is supported by 40 ancient columns, and in its construction resembles Santo Stefano Rotondo in Rome. The walls are covered with frescoes from the 14th century.

The company traded between 1927 and 1931. Cirrus engines were originally built by ADC Aircraft until Cirrus Aero Engines Limited was formed in 1927. The company became Cirrus Hermes in 1931 when it was bought by the Cirrus-Hermes Engineering Company and later became the Cirrus Engine Section of Blackburn & General Aircraft Limited in 1934, and operated as a separate division until production ended in the post-World War II era. Cirrus's first product was the 90 hp (67 kW) Cirrus I, which passed its 50-hour type rating in 1925. It was the first air-cooled inline engine, a design that proved extremely popular for light aircraft. The basic layout was quickly copied by a number of other manufacturers. Later versions named the Cirrus II, and Cirrus III were produced each with slightly greater displacement, and power. After purchase by Hermes the Cirrus Hermes I, II, III & IV were produced ranging in power from 105 hp to 140 hp depending on type. The later Cirrus engines were designed to run inverted. </doc> <doc id="2341163" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341163" title="Private community"> Private community A private community is a residential community that can be an association or a proprietary organization. Associations can include condominiums, homeowner associations or cooperatives. Whereas governmental communities are financed with taxation, where taxes typically have little connection with benefits, private communities are financed as payments for benefits. In a hotel, for example, the public goods such as elevators and security are paid for from room charges. One early American example was Lucas Place, laid out in 1851 in St. Louis, Missouri, the first of about 50 such private places unique to the city. Today, there are "60 million people who now live in roughly 300,000 private communities" in the United States. A noteworthy Canadian example, Arbutus Ridge Seaside Community for Active Adults in the Cowichan Valley on Vancouver Island was the first comprehensive retirement community built in Canada. It subsequently became the template and proving ground for the now accepted and commonplace age-restricted community. </doc> <doc id="2341164" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341164" title="Baar"> Baar Baar can refer to: </doc> <doc id="2341165" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341165" title="Anne Portugal"> Anne Portugal Anne Portugal (born March 29, 1949) is a French poet who lives and works in Paris. She was born in Angers (Maine-et-Loire) and attended Paris 8 University in the suburbs of Paris. Her work is influenced by, and often references, Jacques Roubaud as well as contemporary sources such as instruction booklets and video games. Her recent work "Définitif bob" (translated both by Jennifer Moxley as "absolute bob" as well as by Norma Cole as "Virtual bob" ) has been the subject of considerable critical and popular interest. It is speculated that bob is short for bobine, a French word meaning "coil" and the origin of the English word "bobbin". bob (lower-case is mandatory) is a character (a minuscule joker) who lives in a television set ("la télé où il est mais dedans à l'envers", "the telly where he is but inside the wrong way round") who is a specialist in the "mission serrée horizontale" ("close-fought horizontal mission" is one possible translation). A recurring motif is "bob il peut comme ça" (untranslatable, perhaps "bob, just like that, ...").

Under his reign the dynasty had its greatest period as he extended its frontier as far south as Mysore. He was a skilful administrator, artist, poet and a generous patron of the arts. He reverted to the Sunni sect of Islam, but remained tolerant of other religions, including Christianity. However, during his reign high-ranking Shiite immigrants became unwelcome and in 1590, he ordered the confinement of criers who read the khutba in the Shia form. After his reign, increasing weakness permitted Mughal encroachment and the successful revolt of the Maratha king Shivaji, who killed the Bijapur general Afzal Khan and scattered his army. The dynasty left a tradition of cosmopolitan culture and artistic patronage whose architectural remains are to be seen in the capital city of Bijapur. Ibrahim Adil Shah (the father of Ali Adil Shah I) had divided power between the Sunni nobles, the Habshis and the Deccanis. However, Ali Adil Shah favoured the Shi'i. After the death of Ali Adil Shah I in 1580, the kingdom's nobles appointed Imran Ibrahim, son of Imran Sayzada Tahmash Adil Shah and nephew of Ali Adil Shah I, as king. At this time, Ibrahim Adil Shah II was a nine-year-old boy. Kamal Khan (a Deccani general) seized power and became the regent. Kamal Khan showed disrespect to the Dowager queen Chand Bibi, who felt that he had ambitions to usurp the throne. Chand Bibi plotted an attack against Kamal Khan, with help from another general, Haji Kishvar Khan. Kamal Khan was captured while fleeing and was beheaded at the fort. Kishvar Khan was the second regent of Ibrahim. He defeated the Ahmadnagar Sultanate at Dharaseo, capturing all the artillery and elephants of the enemy army. He ordered other Bijapur generals to surrender the highly valued elephants that they had captured. The generals, along with Chand Bibi, hatched a plan to eliminate Kishvar Khan with help from General Mustafa Khan of Bankapur. Kishvar Khan's spies informed him of the conspiracy. Kishvar Khan sent troops against Mustafa Khan, who was captured and killed in the battle. Chand Bibi challenged Kishvar Khan, who had her imprisoned at the Satara fort and tried to declare himself the king. However, Kishvar Khan was already unpopular among the rest of the generals. He was forced to flee when a joint army, led by General Ikhlas Khan, marched to Bijapur. The army consisted of forces of three Habshi nobles: Ikhlas Khan, Hamid Khan and Dilavar Khan. Kishvar Khan attacked Ahmednagar unsuccessfully and then fled to Golconda. He was killed in exile by a relative of Mustafa Khan. Chand Bibi was then declared the regent. Ikhlas Khan became regent for a short time, but he was dismissed by Chand Bibi shortly afterwards. Later, he resumed his dictatorship, which was soon challenged by other Habshi generals. Taking advantage of the situation in Bijapur, Ahmadnagar's Nizam Shahi sultan allied with the Qutb Shahi of Golconda to attack Bijapur. The troops available at Bijapur were not sufficient to repulse the joint attack. The Habshi generals realised that they could not defend the city alone and tendered their resignations to Chand Bibi. Abu-ul-Hassan, a Shi'a general appointed by Chand Bibi, called for the Maratha forces in Carnatic. The Marathas attacked the invaders' supply lines, forcing the Ahmednagar-Golconda allied army to retreat. Ikhlas Khan then attacked Dilavar Khan to seize control of Bijapur. However, he was defeated and Dilavar Khan became the supreme ruler from 1582 to 1591. He was the last regent of Ibrahim. The fifth king of the Adil Shahi dynasty is known in Indian history as Jagadguru Badshah. He loved music and played musical instruments. For him, the Tanpura personified learning – "Ibrahim the tanpurawala became learned due to grace of god, living in the city of Vidyanagari" (Vidyanagari is the earlier name of Bijapur.) He composed poems on his wife Chand Sultana, his Tanpura Motikhan and his elephant Atish Khan. Ibrahim II publicly declared that all he wanted was Vidya or learning, music, and Guruseva (serving the teacher). He was a devotee of Hazrat Banda Nawaj, the Sufi saint of Gulbarga. He composed a prayer to him to bestow Vidya or learning and charitable disposition. He founded a new township at Navraspur to give concrete shape to his idea of a musical city. He had a temple built inside the precincts of the palace that still exists. Bijapur attracted the period's best musicians and dancers because the king was famous as a great connoisseur and patron of music. He spoke Marathi, Dakhani, Urdu and Kannada languages fluently, and like his predecessors, employed several Hindus in top posts. By Chand Sultana: By Kamal Khatun:<br> By Taj Sultan:<br> By Sundar Mahal:<br> By unknown mothers:<br> Ibrahim II wrote the book Kitab-e-Navras (Book of Nine Rasas) in Dakhani. It is a collection of 59 poems and 17 couplets. According to his court-poet Zuhuri, he wrote it to introduce the theory of nine Rasas, which occupies an important place in Indian aesthetics, to acquaint people who knew only the Persian ethos. The book opens with a prayer to Saraswati, the Goddess of learning. "bhaka nyari nyari bhava ek kaha turuk kaha barahaman" "Whether a Turk (Muslim) or a Brahmin with different language—emotion is the same." "nouras soor juga joti ani saroguni yusat sarasuti mata ibrahim parasada bhayi dooni" "Oh mother Saraswati!

The United States recognized Afghanistan, then under the rule of King Amānullāh, on July 26, 1921. Diplomatic relations were established in 1935. The first ambassador appointed to Afghanistan was William H. Hornibrook, who was concurrently commissioned to Persia, as Iran was known then, and resident in Tehran. Until 1942, the U.S. Ambassador to Persia/Iran was also the Ambassador to Afghanistan. The U.S. Legation at Kabul was established on June 6, 1942, with Charles W. Thayer as Chargé d’Affaires ad interim. Cornelius Van Hemert Engert presented his credentials to the government of Afghanistan on July 2, 1942, as the first envoy solely accredited to Afghanistan. Ambassador Adolph Dubs was assassinated in a botched kidnapping attempt in 1979. For the next ten years no ambassador was appointed; only a series of chargés d’affaires represented the U.S. in Kabul. The embassy at Kabul was closed on January 30, 1989, due to concerns that the new regime would not be able to maintain security and protect diplomats following the final departure of Soviet forces from the country. Following the overthrow of the Taliban government, the U.S. Liaison Office in Kabul opened on December 17, 2001, with Ambassador James Dobbins serving as Director. The United States recognized the Afghan Interim Administration on December 22, 2001, when it assumed the authority to represent Afghanistan in its external relations. The embassy reopened on January 17, 2002, with Ryan Crocker as Chargé d’Affaires "a.i." The U.S. Embassy to Afghanistan is located in Kabul. Note: The names of the chargés heading the Afghanistan mission between Hornibrook’s departure in 1936 and the arrival of Dreyfus in 1941 have not been recorded. Note: Legation Kabul was opened June 6, 1942 with Charles W. Thayer as Chargé d’Affaires "ad interim". Note: During Palmer’s tenure as envoy, the Legation was elevated to Embassy status on June 5, 1948, when Palmer presented his credentials to the Afghan government. Note: Peter Tomsen served as Special Envoy to Afghanistan (to the Northern Alliance) 1989–1992. Note: The U.S. Embassy Kabul was closed in January 1989. The Embassy was reopened January 17, 2002. </doc> <doc id="2341178" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341178" title="Hadrocodium"> Hadrocodium Hadrocodium wui ("hadro" from Greek ἁδρός/"hadros", "large, heavy, fullness"; Latin: "codium", from Greek κώδεια/"kodeia", "head [of a plant]" (alluding to its enlarged cranial cavity); and "wui", the Latinized version of discoverer Xiao-Chun Wu's name) is an extinct mammaliaform that lived during the Sinemurian stage of the Early Jurassic approximately in the Lufeng basin in what is now the Yunnan province in south-western China (, paleocoordinates ). The fossil of this mouse-like, paper-clip sized animal was discovered in 1985 but was then interpreted as a juvenile morganucodontid. "Hadrocodium" remained undescribed until 2001; since then its large brain and advanced ear structure have greatly influenced the interpretation of the earliest stages of mammalian evolution, as these mammalian characters could previously be traced only to some . "Hadrocodium" is known only from a skull, but the body is estimated to have been a mere in length and about in mass, making it one of the smallest mammals ever. "Hadrocodium" might have been the first animal to have a nearly fully mammalian middle ear. It is the earliest known example of several features possessed only by mammals, including the middle-ear structure characteristic of modern mammals and a relatively large brain cavity. These features had been considered limited to the crown group mammals, which emerged in the Middle Jurassic; the discovery of "Hadrocodium" suggests that these attributes appeared 45 million years earlier than previously thought. Whether "Hadrocodium" was warm-blooded or cold-blooded has not been settled, although its apparent nocturnal features would seem to place it in the endotherm group. </doc> <doc id="2341198" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341198" title="Merge (version control)"> Merge (version control) In version control, merging (also called integration) is a fundamental operation that reconciles multiple changes made to a version-controlled collection of files. Most often, it is necessary when a file is modified on two independent branches and subsequently merged. The result is a single collection of files that contains both sets of changes. In some cases, the merge can be performed automatically, because there is sufficient history information to reconstruct the changes, and the changes do not conflict. In other cases, a person must decide exactly what the resulting files should contain. Many revision control software tools include merge capabilities. There are two types of merges: automatic and manual. Automatic merging is what version control software does when it reconciles changes that have happened simultaneously (in a logical sense.) Also, other pieces of software deploy automatic merging if they allow for editing the same content simultaneously. For instance, Wikipedia allows two people to edit the same article at the same time; when the latter contributor saves, their changes are merged into the article instead of overwriting the previous set of changes. Manual merging is what people have to resort to (possibly assisted by merging tools) when they have to reconcile files that differ. For instance, if two systems have slightly differing versions of a configuration file and a user wants to have the good stuff in both, this can usually be achieved by merging the configuration files by hand, picking the wanted changes from both sources (this is also called two-way merging). Manual merging is also required when automatic merging runs into a change conflict; for instance, very few automatic merge tools can merge two changes to the same line of code (say, one that changes a function name, and another that adds a comment). In these cases, revision control systems resort to the user to specify the intended merge result. Merge algorithms are an area of active research, and consequently there are many different approaches to automatic merging, with subtle differences. The more notable merge algorithms include three-way merge, recursive three-way merge, fuzzy patch application, weave merge, and patch commutation. A three-way merge is performed after an automated difference analysis between a file "A" and a file "B" while also considering the origin, or common ancestor, of both files "C". It is a rough merging method, but widely applicable since it only requires one common ancestor to reconstruct the changes that are to be merged. The three-way merge looks for sections which are the same in only two of the three files. In this case, there are two versions of the section, and the version which is in the common ancestor "C" is discarded, while the version that differs is preserved in the output. If "A" and "B" agree, that is what appears in the output. A section that is the same in "A" and "C" outputs the changed version in "B", and likewise a section that is the same in "B" and "C" outputs the version in "A". Sections that are different in all three files are marked as a conflict situation and left for the user to resolve. Three-way merging is implemented by the ubiquitous diff3 program, and was the central innovation that allowed the switch from file-locking based revision control systems to merge-based revision control systems. It is extensively used by the Concurrent Versions System (CVS). Three-way merge based revision control tools are widespread, but the technique fundamentally depends on finding a common ancestor of the versions to be merged. There are awkward cases, particularly the "criss-cross merge", where a unique last common ancestor of the modified versions does not exist. Fortunately, in this case it can be shown that there are at most two possible candidate ancestors, and recursive three-way merge constructs a "virtual ancestor" by merging the non-unique ancestors first. This merge can itself suffer the same problem, so the algorithm recursively merges them. Since there is a finite number of versions in the history, the process is guaranteed to eventually terminate. This technique is used by the Git revision control tool. Recursive three-way merge can only be used in situations where the tool has knowledge about the total ancestry directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the derivatives to be merged. Consequently, it cannot be used in situations where derivatives or merges do not fully specify their parent(s). A patch is a file that contains a description of changes to a file. In the Unix world, there has been a tradition to disseminate changes to text files as patches in the format that is produced by "diff -u". This format can then be used by the patch program to re-apply (or remove) the changes into (or from) a text file, or a directory structure containing text files. However, the patch program also has some facilities to apply the patch into a file that is not exactly similar as the origin file that was used to produce the patch. This process is called "fuzzy patch application", and results in a kind of asymmetric three-way merge, where the changes in the patch are discarded if the patch program cannot find a place where to apply them. Like CVS started as a set of scripts on diff3, GNU arch started as a set of scripts on patch. However, fuzzy patch application is a relatively untrustworthy method, sometimes misapplying patches that have too little context (especially ones that create a new file), sometimes refusing to apply deletions that both derivatives have done. Weave merge is an algorithm that does not make use of a common ancestor for two files. Instead, it tracks how single "lines" are added and deleted in derivative versions of files, and produces the merged file on this information. For each line in the derivative files, weave merge collects the following information: which lines precede it, which follow it, and whether it was deleted at some stage of either derivative's history. If either derivative has had the line deleted at some point, it must not be present in the merged version. For other lines, they must be present in the merged version. The lines are sorted into an order where each line is after all lines that have preceded it at some point in history, and before all lines that have followed it at some point in history. If these constraints do not give a total ordering for all lines, then the lines that do not have an ordering with respect to each other are additions that conflict. Weave merge was apparently used by the commercial revision control tool BitKeeper and can handle some of the problem cases where a three-way merge produces wrong or bad results. It is also one of the merge options of the GNU Bazaar revision control tool, and is used in Codeville. Patch commutation is used in Darcs to merge changes, and is also implemented in git (but called "rebasing"). Patch commutation merge means changing the order of patches (i.e. descriptions of changes) so that they form a linear history. In effect, when two patches are made in the context of a common situation, upon merging, one of them is rewritten so that it appears to be done in the context of the other. Patch commutation requires that the exact changes that made derivative files are stored or can be reconstructed. From these exact changes it is possible to compute how one of them should be changed in order to rebase it on the other. For instance, if patch A adds line "X" after line 7 of file F and patch B adds line "Y" after line 310 of file F, B has to be rewritten if it is rebased on A: the line must be added on line 311 of file F, because the line added in A offsets the line numbers by one. Patch commutation has been studied a great deal formally, but the algorithms for dealing with merge conflicts in patch commutation still remain open research questions. However, patch commutation can be proven to produce "correct" merge results where other merge strategies are mostly heuristics that try to produce what users want to see. The Unix program flipdiff from the "patchutils" package implements patch commutation for traditional patches produced by diff -u. The technological advancements in the 3-way merge method have led to the increase in popularity among software development environments to institute concurrent modification through branching in their practices of software configuration management (SCM). In the early to mid-1990s branching was a discouraged practice in smaller software development groups due to the complexities and conflicts introduced through the merging process and the low availability of cost-effective 3-way merge tools. However, this practice was more in demand among larger groups merely due to the increased likelihood that two developers would need to modify the same file at the same time. Merging, at that time, was indeed a challenge and in some environments, additional proprietary conventions were introduced to simplify the necessary merge. In the early 2000s, the increased availability of reliable 3-way merge tools reduced the time that software development groups had to spend concerning themselves with the technical limitations of their infrastructure. Even smaller software groups are more inclined to approach concurrent modification in their revision control systems. Software developers use a variety of tools and techniques to facilitate 3-way merges, including visual tools for viewing changes side by side. Resolving conflicts in 3-way merges still remains one of the more taxing tasks of any software development team. This is especially because the person resolving the merge needs prior knowledge of the original code, the intermediate conflicting changes, and the result wanted. </doc> <doc id="2341208" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341208" title="Calvary Christian High School (Florida)"> Calvary Christian High School (Florida) Calvary Christian High School is a private, college preparatory Christian high school in Clearwater, Florida, in the United States. </doc> <doc id="2341212" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341212" title="Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC)"> Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (consul 189 BC) Marcus Fulvius Nobilior, Roman general, a member of one of the most important families of the plebeian Fulvia gens. He started his political career as curule aedile in 195 BC. When praetor (193 BC) he served with distinction in Spain, and as consul in 189 BC he completely broke the power of the Aetolian League. On his return to Rome, Nobilior celebrated a triumph (of which full details are given by Livy) remarkable for the magnificence of the spoils exhibited. On his Aetolian campaign he was accompanied by the poet Ennius, who made the capture of Ambracia, at which he was present, the subject of one of his plays. For this Nobilior was strongly opposed by Cato the Censor, on the ground that he had compromised his dignity as a Roman general. In 179 BC he was appointed censor together with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. He restored the temple of Hercules and the Muses in the Circus Flaminius, placed in it a list of Fasti drawn up by himself, and endeavoured to make the Roman calendar more generally known. He was a great enthusiast for Greek art and culture, and introduced many of its masterpieces into Rome, amongst them the picture of the Muses by Zeuxis from Ambracia. Fulvius was grandson of Servius Fulvius Paetinus Nobilior (consul in 255 BC). He was named for his father. He had two sons, both of whom obtained the consulship: Marcus Fulvius Nobilior (in 159 BC) and Quintus Fulvius Nobilior (in 153 BC). </doc> <doc id="2341213" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341213" title="Ramon Dekkers"> Ramon Dekkers Ramon "The Diamond" Dekkers (4 September 1969 – 27 February 2013) was a Dutch kickboxer and an eight time Muay Thai world champion. Dekkers was a favourite with fight fans due to his fast-paced, aggressive fighting style. Dekkers was also renowned for his willingness to go abroad to fight the Thai champions in their own country. Dekkers was born on 4 September 1969 in Breda, Netherlands. He began learning martial arts at age 12, studying judo for half a year. He then switched to boxing. After a couple of years Dekkers started practicing Muay Thai under Cor Hemmers. After finishing his baker education Dekkers joined Maeng Ho Breda Gym. During Dekkers early days of training his mother was at the gym every day and eventually she and Hemmers fell in love and got married. In the beginning of his career Dekkers' manager was Clovis Depretz, the manager of legendary Rob Kaman. This was the reason why Kaman was at ringside during many of Dekkers' matches, including his farewell fight. They often trained together and became good friends. Dekkers and Kaman were dubbed by fight fans in Thailand as "The Double Dutch duo". In his first fight at 16 years of age, Dekkers won in a spectacular knockout against a well-established older boxer. Although, only weighing about 55 kg, his opponents found out sooner rather than later he was much stronger than he looked. As Dekkers kept on winning his matches by knockout, his reputation of an up-and-coming fighter spread in the Muay Thai community. He was awarded his first title at age 18, when he won the MTBN Dutch Championship on 15 November 1987. Dekkers defeated Ramkisoen by knockout with a high kick. Previous to this fight the Dutchman had his first international contest against the reigning European champion, Richard Nam of France. Dekkers lost the fight on points. They would rematch each other a year later for the EMTA European Championship. This time Dekkers won the fight by knockout with a left hook, cross to body combination in the fourth round. Dekkers challenged for the NKBB European Super featherweight Championship against Kevin Morris on 14 April 1988. He defeated his overmatched English opponent by unanimous decision. Over the next year the Dutchman would win a number of fights before defeating Mungkordum Sitchang for the IMTA World Lightweight title. Towards the end of 1988 he faced Gilbert Ballantine from the respected Chakuriki Gym in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Dekkers lost by decision after being outworked by Ballantine over five rounds. This match would spark the beginning of a fierce rivalry between the two men – they would fight two more times with both of them splitting wins. On 18 February 1990, Dekkers truly moved onto the world stage. In Amsterdam, he faced the reigning Lumpinee champion Nongkee Pahuyuth. He inflicted a rare defeat on Namphon after five rounds, taking the IMF World Light Welterweight title. Throughout the bout, Dekkers controlled the fight, scoring two knockdowns. The two fighters would meet again two months later in a rematch in Bangkok, Thailand. This time the Dutchman, who just had knocked out the number 1 ranked Lumpinee fighter Cherry S. Wanich in Amsterdam, was unable to defeat Namphon and lost a close decision. He returned to Thailand the same year to meet Issara Sakkreerin in a losing bid for Sakkreerin's Lumpinee Stadium Lightweight title. The most notable rival of Dekkers was multiple Lumpinee champion and living legend Coban Lookchaomaesaitong. In their first encounter on 21 April 1991, Dekkers was knocked out with a left hook. This would be the first of four meetings between the men from 1991 to 1993, in what became one of the biggest feuds in Muay Thai history. In the rematch, Dekkers won in highlight worthy fashion via devastating knockout. In the third outing of their rivalry, Dekkers was defeated by decision after five gruelling rounds, but he won the fourth and final fight, evening his score against Coban. The Coban vs. Dekkers fights have been rated as the best by any standards, by Muay Thai fans worldwide. Dekkers ended 1991 with two wins by knockout over French champion Joel Cezar and a decision loss against Sakmongkol Sitthichok. Between 1992 and 1996, Dekkers would take part in a number of high-profile bouts, defeating fighters such as Joe Prestia, Rittichai Tor. Chalermchai, Mehmet Kaya and Hector Pena. He would also suffer a few defeats, losing his second fight against Joe Prestia as well as failing to defeat among others Jaroenthong Kiatbangchon, Dida Diafat, Orono Por Muang-Ubol and Den Muangsurin. On November 16, 1996, Dekkers defeated Hassan Kassrioui via unanimous decision in Amsterdam, Netherlands to win the World Professional Kickboxing League (WPKL) World Super Welterweight Championship. By this point, despite the victory, injuries were taking their toll and his career was winding to a close. A month later, he faced Jomhod Kiatadisak in Bangkok, Thailand for the vacant WMTA World Super welterweight title. Dekkers lost the bout by decision. In a memorable match against Rayen Simson in Roosendaal, Netherlands in 1997 both fighters went to the canvas at the same time from a left hook. Dekkers injured his eye in the process and had to give up, losing the fight by technical knockout at the end of the second round. He would go back to winning ways by defeating Saengtiennoi Sor. Rungrot, avenging his two losses against the "Deadly Kisser". On 18 March 2001, Ramon Dekkers fought his farewell fight against Marino Deflorin in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The fight ended in the fourth round with Dekkers knocking a game Deflorin out with a left hook. After the fight, Dekkers joined his Golden Glory team members center stage for a finale, Rob Kaman came down the rampart, presenting a Golden Glory torch to Dekkers, who in turn passed it to each team member, as video clips of his victories were shown on the display screens. After his retirement Dekkers kept himself busy training his two teams, Team Dekkers and Golden Glory. In 2005 however, Dekkers surprised the fighting world by agreeing upon a contract with K-1. He was, however, to fight under MMA rules against Genki Sudo. Dekkers, who never had fought MMA, and took the fight by a few days notice, lost by heel hook. However, his management arranged another regular K-1 rules fight. Dekkers fought American Duane Ludwig in a superfight during the K-1 Max 2005 event. A few days before the fight Dekkers injured himself, tearing a ligament in his right shoulder. The entire fight he could only punch with his left arm. Nevertheless, Dekkers knocked Ludwig down in every round, and won the fight by decision. His final retirement was a superfight against Joerie Mes at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Amsterdam event on 13 May 2006, this event was organised by Dutch organisation It's Showtime in collaboration with the Japanse K-1 organisation. After both fighters suffered a knockdown in the second round, it was Mes who earned the decision victory. Immediately after the fight Dekkers announced his final retirement. Ramon Dekkers fought some of the best fighters Thailand had to offer. Especially in the beginning it was hard for Dekkers to fight at full Thai rules. The scoring methods were different than he was used to in Europe. "In Thailand it is very difficult to win other than by knocking your opponent out. It has happened to me in many of my fights that I have lost on "points" while fighting in Thailand. It's normal over there losing on points but it can be very frustrating.", Dekkers stated in an interview in 1993. Dekkers also blamed some of his losses to his many injuries. Despite his defeats the Thai fight fans had a great respect for Dekkers' determination and ability. On the occasion of the 85th anniversary of the King of Thailand, Dekkers received a royal award from the Thai Royal Family for his services to the sport. The Dutchman was also appointed ambassador of all foreign fighters in Thailand. "This is very important to me. It is the greatest recognition that I can get for what I have achieved in this sport," said Dekkers, after the presentation by the Thai princess Ubolratana Rajakanya, the eldest daughter of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. On 27 February 2013, Dekkers died at the age of 43, after reportedly feeling light headed while training in his hometown Breda. He was riding his bike when he collapsed. A few bystanders attempted to assist him before emergency services arrived and attempted to revive him to no avail. It was reported that myocardial infarction (heart attack) was the cause of death. Hundreds of family members and friends farewelled Dekkers at his funeral at the Zuylen cemetery. The funeral procession was accompanied by dozens of members of the Motorbike Club Satudarah, while an airplane with a banner reading "The Diamond 4Ever, rest in peace" circled above the town. </doc> <doc id="2341216" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341216" title="1934 European Athletics Championships"> 1934 European Athletics Championships The 1st European Athletics Championships were held in Turin, Italy, at the Stadio Benito Mussolini between 7 and 9 September 1934.

The men's event took place in Paris, France between 3–5 September while the women's events were in Vienna, Austria (at the time part of German Reich) on 17 and 18 September. A total of 32 events were contested at the two competitions, comprising 23 events for men and 9 for women. This was the first time that events for women were held and the only occasion on which the competition was held in two separate locations. Germany topped the medals table with twelve gold medals and 32 in total. Finland won the second greatest number of gold medals (5) and eleven medals in total. The next most successful nations were Great Britain (four golds and eight overall) and Sweden (three golds and a total of thirteen medals). France won a medal of each colour in Paris, with Prudent Joye the sole Frenchman to win a gold for the hosts of the men's championships. In the men's competition at Stade Olympique de Colombes in Paris, Donald Finlay of Great Britain broke the European record to win the 110 metres hurdles. Tinus Osendarp of the Netherlands won a sprint double, breaking two championship records. World record holder Sydney Wooderson took victory in the 1500 metres while Olympic gold medallists Matti Järvinen (javelin), Karl Hein (hammer) and Harold Whitlock (50 km walk) won their specialities. Finnish runners Taisto Mäki, Ilmari Salminen and Väinö Muinonen won all three of the long distance running events at the championships, upholding the country's reputation as the Flying Finns. Contemporaneous reports on the men's event were given in the Glasgow Herald. Stanisława Walasiewicz of Poland excelled in the women's events at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna, winning both the 100 and 200 metres, as well as silver medals in the long jump and 4 x 100 metres relay. Italian athlete Claudia Testoni set a world record of 11.6 seconds over the 80 metres hurdles. Outside these highlights, the German women dominated the competition by winning 15 of the 27 women's medals on offer. Among them were Käthe Krauß (who won two silvers in the sprints), 1936 Berlin Olympics champion Gisela Mauermayer (who won the discus and a silver in the shot put) and Lisa Gelius, who completed a usual double of silver in the hurdles and gold in the javelin throw. Among the minor medallists was Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won the first international medals of her highly successful career. Dora Ratjen was the initial winner of the women's high jump, but this was rescinded after it was discovered that he was in fact a man. A contemporaneous report on the women's event was given in the Glasgow Herald. Complete results were published. According to an unofficial count, 350 athletes from 23 countries participated in the event, two athletes less than the official number of 352 as published. </doc> <doc id="2341225" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341225" title="Zalambdalestes"> Zalambdalestes Zalambdalestes (meaning "much-like-lambda robber") was a eutherian mammal, most likely not a placental due to the presence of an epipubic bone, living during the Upper Cretaceous in Mongolia. Its diet was probably composed mainly of insects that it hunted in the forest undergrowth using its sharp, interlocking teeth. Unlike modern placental mammals, "Zalambdalestes" had an epipubic bone, meaning it was probably restricted reproductively in the same way as modern monotremes and marsupials. </doc> <doc id="2341226" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341226" title="Bit-Tech"> Bit-Tech bit-tech is an online magazine for computer hardware enthusiasts, gamers and case modders, based in the UK. It was founded in 2000, became a fully professional online publication in 2005, and announced its acquisition by Dennis Publishing in October 2008. Dennis Publishing then partnered the site with existing monthly publication Custom PC magazine, making Bit-Tech the online version of the magazine. At this point the two editorial teams were totally integrated. However, due to a restructure in January 2012 the website and magazine now have separate editors again, although several of the writers still contribute material to both publications. It is now owned by The Media Team. The website caters specifically for the computer hardware enthusiast market, providing reviews and articles on higher end hardware and games. Bit-Tech is also prominent in the custom case modding scene, providing a focus point for professional and amateur case modders. Much of the site’s content and writing style revolve around this particular reader-base, and its regular readers have been responsible for some of the most well known case mods, such as Orac3 and the Blackmesa HL2 mod. Originally bit-tech.net was designed to be a small site where people who were interested in case modding could see new ideas from the team and discuss them in the forums, due to the relatively small presence of modding at the time. It has since diversified and, along with the trend-setting case mods, bit-tech now also features detailed reviews of computer hardware and video games, industry news and editorials. There is now increased coverage of console games, though PC games are still the major focus. Wil Harris was Editor-in-Chief of bit-tech for almost six years and in February 2007, he announced that he was stepping down the end of March 2007 to move onto a fresh challenge. At the time, Wil's successor was not announced and it was not until April 2007 that Tim Smalley announced that he would be taking over as Editor with immediate effect. After Tim had successfully led the site to acquisition by Dennis Publishing in October 2008, he integrated it into the new owner's technology portfolio and then stood down as Editor in April 2010 after launching a new consumer technology website at Dennis, Expert Reviews, at the start of the year. Alex Watson took over as bit-tech's Editor with immediate effect and was replaced by former deputy editor of Custom PC James Gorbold in December 2010. In January 2012, Dennis publishing restructured the editorial team and Simon Brew took on the role of managing editor of the site. In February 2013, Simon Brew stepped down and Dennis publishing appointed Edward Chester as Editor. In April 2014 bit-tech was acquired by David Ross, who operates HEXUS and BOXFX as brands. "bit-tech" first became widely known for its community of PC case modders who would re-shape and decorate PC hardware into a variety of more creative forms. Although the site has since expanded to include hardware and games reviews, it still runs regular modding coverage including the very popular Mod of the Month and Mod of the Year competitions and regular project articles. In 2012, "bit-tech" launched the Case Mod Index - an ever-growing database of computer mods, sorted by case manufacturers such as Cooler Master or SilverStone. You're able to see all computer mods based on a specific case, as well as browse dozens of completed projects. "bit-tech" has been host to some of the most popular and striking mods on the Internet, including the BlackMesa Mod (currently on show at Valve), Cygnus X1, Anemone Mod, Macro Black and Lian-Li GOO Mod. "bit-tech" uses an arguably more in-depth review model than many other review sites and has a strong focus on PC titles, though console and handheld reviews are increasingly common. Video game reviews do not just provide a commentary of gameplay but also include graphical analysis and a breakdown of how the game will look on different hardware. This review model means that video game reviews are typically much longer than reviews from other sites, though console reviews are a more traditional length. "bit-tech" employs a percentage scoring system with 'Approved' and 'Premium' awards. Unlike many review sites, "bit-tech" uses the full range of this scale and scores poor games harshly, with 50% used to represent average games. While the writing style of the site often leans towards New Games Journalism, this has mostly been downplayed since the site was bought by Dennis Publishing and the current writing style is similar to that of partnered magazine, Custom PC Magazine as the site and magazine are written by the same editorial team. Recently the site has moved to embrace the indie games community and has run several features exploring and supporting this side of the PC industry. Several prominent independent developers, including Introversion Software and writers from Free Radical Design have written columns for the site which explore a number of issues in and around the games industry. In 2011 bit-tech's games section was rebranded as bit-gamer and now sits alongside the main site as a separate games website. </doc> <doc id="2341229" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341229" title="Hulman Center"> Hulman Center Hulman Center is a 10,200-seat multi-purpose arena in Terre Haute, Indiana, USA.

Sir Martin Mar-all, Sir Davy Dunce and Sir Credulous Easy were among his favourite parts. His success as the Nurse in Nevil Payne's "Fatal Jealousy" was so great that he was thereafter nicknamed "Nurse Nokes." Nokes was one of the male actors who played female roles in the newly reopened playhouses shortly after the Restoration of Charles II. This practice didn't last long, as Thomas Killigrew's King's Company put the first English actress on the stage on December 1660, and from then on they appeared more and more frequently, until in 1662 Charles II ordered that only women should play female roles. There was a brief period in late 1660 and early 1661 when both men and women were playing female roles. On 29 January 1661, the diarist Samuel Pepys went to the Duke’s playhouse, where "after great patience and little expectation, from so poor beginning, I saw three acts of ‘The Mayd in ye Mill’ acted to my great content." It was Nokes who was playing the title female role of the Mayd. </doc> <doc id="2341241" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341241" title="Gentry Complex"> Gentry Complex Gentry Complex is a multi-purpose facility on the main campus of Tennessee State University (TSU) in Nashville, Tennessee.

It was originated by Raymond Dart in the 1950s; later it was developed further in "African Genesis" by Robert Ardrey in 1961. According to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other primate species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many murderous instincts. The theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do violence was a fundamental part of human psychology. The hunting hypothesis is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both. The expression "killer ape" does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression. As founder of this thesis, Raymond A. Dart (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article "The predatory transition from ape to man", 1953. Dart refers to the Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology. The question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. Smith excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion. Until Raymond Dart found the Australopithecus africanus (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved. This approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “Taung Child”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. Robert Broom (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the Australopithecus africanus. However, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow. Both Dart and Broom, as well as Charles Darwin (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry. Osseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes. These findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed. This new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals. Dart carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt Dart to bring them more in line with humans. Observations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in "The predatory transition from ape to man" by Raymond Dart. He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior. Concerning the eating habits from then until now, Dart argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive cannibalism) are the results. A deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive. The comment written by the editor of Dart’s article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of Dart and Ardrey. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of "nobody else".” Another obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of Dart’s thesis by a scientific convention at Livingstone (Zambia, Southern Africa), which led Ardrey into writing his book "African Genesis". He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor. The ethologist Konrad Lorenz also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book "On Aggression" (1963). In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict. The Seville Statement on Violence, released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular warfare as genetically determined. A 2008 article in "Nature" by Dan Jones stated that "A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought." Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the Cinderella effect). Chimpanzees have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between ingroup and outgroup which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced blood feuds due to better functioning justice systems may have contributed to declining intra-group violence. The idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book "War, Peace, and Human Nature" (2013), edited by Douglas P. Fry. Movies such as "Planet of the Apes" (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on Pierre Boulle’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic. This theory can be seen in the opening sequence of "", and also appears in the television show "Sliders", which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs. (The names of "Dart" and "Ardrey" were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into ""Drayer"" who purportedly came up with his world's "killer ape theory".) </doc> <doc id="2341248" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341248" title="1946 European Athletics Championships"> 1946 European Athletics Championships The 3rd European Athletics Championships were held from 22 August to 25 August 1946 in the Bislett Stadion in Oslo, Norway.

The island is roughly trapezoidal in shape, with a maximum length of 0.8 km and a maximum width of 0.3 km and is nearly flat, rising 14 m out of the [[North Atlantic]]. The island is composed of [[feldspar|feldspathic]] [[granite]] and is traversed by two distinct fault lines which cross the island in a northwesterly direction, almost parallel to each other. The fault lines divide the island into three separate entities. The northeastern portion consists mainly of bare rock; the central portion has scattered vegetation; and the largest portion of the island, the southwestern, which occupies over half of the land surface, is covered with grasses, [[lichen]]s and [[moss]]es. Landing on Funk Island is extremely difficult and dangerous, though in calm weather there are three points where a safe landing can be effected. Gannet Head, the southwestern corner of the island, and Landing Rock, just north of Gannet Head, are two such places. On the north side, approximately 0.17 km west of Escape Point, the easternmost tip of the island, there is a steep cliff. Set in the cliff is a natural shelf, called The Bench, approximately 1.2 m wide, which slopes up the cliff face which allow relatively easy access to the surface. The cold [[Labrador Current]] provides good breeding ground for cold water fish which in turn support the large breeding seabird population of the island. At high tide the seas break widely against the cliffs and in particularly high seas waves break over the island. There are two large rock bunkers which lie off the southwest side of the island. The two bunkers are washed over by the sea, and provide roosting but not nesting areas for many of the seabirds, particularly the gannets. The island and the bunkers make up what is known as the "Funks." There are no navigational aids or lighthouses on the island despite the number of shipwrecks and the loss of life which have occurred in the area. [[File:Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution (1889) (18248087648).jpg|thumb|Map of Funk Island showing concentration of Great Auk remains, 1887]] The name Funk, which means evil odour or vapour, is thought to have been given to the island because of the foul odour which predominates there. The smell arises from the [[nitrate]] and [[phosphate]] concentrations found in the [[guano]] deposited by the many millions of birds which have nested there over the centuries. Some contend that the name may be traced to a [[Norsemen|Norse]] or [[Iceland]]ic word for a [[wikt:haycock|haycock]] which the island resembles. This hypothesis appears unlikely, since the name Funk did not often appear on maps until the late 18th century. Before that time the island was usually referred to by sailors as [[Great Auk|Penguin]] Island. It is believed that [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] visited the island in 1501. Shortly after that date it appears on two maps by [[Pedro Reinel]] as "Y Dos Saues" (1504) and "Ylhas das aves" (1520), both of which refer to an island of birds. A 1626 map by [[Pierre Mortier]] labels the place "I des Penguins", while an [[Italy|Italian]] map dated 1661 has the island marked as "I Penguin Abonda di Vecelli" (Penguin Island abounding with birds). One of the earliest British maps by [[cartography|cartographer]] [[Herman Moll]], dated 1716, refers to it as Penguin Island. The name Funk Island appears on [[James Cook]]'s 1775 map as it does in the charts and surveys compiled in 1765. According to the book Pioneers in Canada (Blackie and Sons 1912) Jacques Cartier in 1534 commented on the great number of birds and [[polar bear]]s on Funk Island. Funk Island was probably called Penguin Island because the [[great auk]] used to nest on this island by thousands, and possibly tens of thousands, up to the late 18th century when its numbers declined drastically. However, the "American Heritage Dictionary" suggests the word "penguin", which may be derived from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] "pen gwyn" meaning "white head", originated with the name of the island and subsequently become a synonym for "great auk". It is believed that Funk Island was visited shortly after the first native peoples settled in northeastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. [[Joseph Banks]], who visited Newfoundland and Labrador in 1766, told of a type of pudding the [[Beothuk]] people made from eggs which had been collected from Penguin (Funk) Island. In earlier times, the [[great auk]] was also known as the garefowl, from the Norse, "geirfugl". In the early 16th century, Europeans were drawn to the codfish schools off the coast of Newfoundland. "Towards the end of a long transatlantic journey, when provisions were running low, fresh meat was prized, and the ease with which auks could be picked off the slab [Funk Island] was soon noted." Many explorers and fishing nations made trips to the Funks to acquire seabirds for food and oil for their lamps. The great auks were flightless birds that were an easy prey. In 1578, 350 [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[France|French]] vessels and fifty [[England|English]] vessels were reported fishing nearby. Later settlers along the northeast coast of Newfoundland often made the short trip to the Funks to kill birds for food and lamp oil; they also used the feathers for pillows and mattresses and gathered the eggs for food. In 1622 Sir [[Richard Whitbourne]] told of how the birds were driven up the [[gang plank]]s into the boats. He remarked that it was ""as if God had made the innocency of so poore a creature to become such an admirable instrument for the sustenation of man."" By 1800 the great auk was probably extinct on Funk Island, and by 1844, in the world. Naturalists and scientists had become interested in the plight of the great auk and by June 1841 a Norwegian naturalist, Dr. [[Peter Stuvitz]] visited Funk Island with the hope of obtaining specimens of the birds, but was forced to leave due to weather conditions on the island. The second visit of a scientific nature occurred in 1863, when [[Thomas Molloy (scientist)|Thomas Molloy]], the United States Consul to Newfoundland, received permission from the Government of Newfoundland to go to the Funk Island to mine remains of the great auk. Thirty-five tons of the decomposed organic material was secured by Molloy's expedition. Of these five tons was sold locally at nineteen dollars a ton while the other thirty tons was shipped to [[Boston]], [[Baltimore]] and [[Washington D.C.]], where it was used to fertilize the gardens of wealthy Americans. In July 1873 [[seismologist]] and [[naturalist]] [[John Milne]] went to the island and was successful in retrieving partial skeletons and miscellaneous bones before inclement weather cut short his stay. He reported that there was an abundance of terns on Funk Island but that the [[murre]] and [[razorbill]] population had been almost destroyed by egg gatherers. In a hazardous landing and in only the one hour that was allowed by the dangerous tides and high waves surrounding the island, Milne discovered in a small, grassy hollow, the skeletal remains of no fewer than fifty birds. Some of them exceeded in size any that had before been known. His collection of great auk skeletons subsequently found its way into various public museums. In a scientific paper he wrote in 1875 describing his trip he included a detailed collection of facts relating to the extinct bird that covered five geographical regions, including prehistoric kitchen middens of [[Caithness]]. The most successful of the early scientific expeditions to Funk Island occurred in 1887. It was sponsored by the [[United States Fish Commission]] and was under the direction of [[Frederick A. Lucas]]. After a brief sojourn in St. John's, the group's ship, "Grampus", arrived at Funk Island on July 22, 1887. They found in their search area, roughly one quarter of the land surface of the island was covered with between .6 and 1.2 m of earth. The earth contained egg shells mixed with granite pebbles in depths ranging from 5 to 30 cm. Many more skeletons were unearthed and taken away for other scientific study. This expedition did other scientific work on Funk Island, including the collection of rock specimens. During their search of the island they also discovered several iron kettles, rusted and broken, which were believed to have been used to scald the bodies of the great auks to make removal of the feathers easier. Near the western edge of the auks' breeding grounds they discovered enclosures made of granite blocks. The Auks had been herded into these compounds to make slaughtering easier. There have been many other expeditions since, right up to 1982. In 1964 the island became a Provincial Wildlife Sanctuary and landing there was prohibited without a permit. With the creation of the sanctuary, the bird population began to be protected and is now monitored by researchers at [[Memorial University of Newfoundland|Memorial University]] and [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] Eleven marine bird species have been known to breed on Funk Island. In 1972 the largest population on the Funk Island was that of the thin-billed or common murre, the population count was 396,461 pairs. That number accounts for 80% of the breeding population in eastern North America and makes Funk Island one of the most important of the seabird colonies in the world. In 1982 the seabird population on Funk Island was estimated at over 1,000,000 birds.

Indore, the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh is the largest city in the region. Other major cities include Bhopal and Raipur. The states share many linguistic and cultural characteristics with the Northern Region including the predominance of Hindi. The states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have been grouped along with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as the Northern Zonal Council for cooperation. The Bhimbetka caves show evidence of paleolithic settlements in present-day Madhya Pradesh. Stone age tools have also been discovered at various places along the Narmada river valley. Chalcolithic sites have been discovered at a number of places including Eran, Kayatha, Maheshwar, Nagda, and Navdatoli. Rock shelters with cave paintings, the earliest of which can be dated to 30,000 BCE, have also been discovered at a number of places. The settlements of humans in present-day Madhya Pradesh developed primarily in the valleys of rivers such as Narmada, Chambal, and Betwa. During the early Vedic period, the Vindhya mountains formed the southern boundary of the Indo-Aryan territory. The Holkars, a powerful family of the Maratha Empire were based out of Indore. Later, the territory that now comprises Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were ruled by numerous princes who entered into subsidiary alliance with the British. After independence, the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956. In 2000, the new state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh. The nominal gross domestic product of Central India is ₹10.25 lakh crore. Central India generates 10.96% of all of India's electricity, largely through coal power plants. The region is part of the Hindi belt, and Modern Standard Hindi is the predominant language. Other Hindi belt languages such as Chhattisgarhi are also common regionally. Besides these Indo-Aryan languages, the Munda-family language Korku is also spoken in Central India. </doc> <doc id="2341265" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341265" title="1954 European Athletics Championships"> 1954 European Athletics Championships The 5th European Athletics Championships were held at Stadion Neufeld from 25–29 August 1954 in the Swiss capital Bern.

He is best known for telling epic stories in lyric metres but he is also famous for some ancient traditions about his life, such as his opposition to the tyrant Phalaris, and the blindness he is said to have incurred and cured by composing verses first insulting and then flattering to Helen of Troy. He was ranked among the nine lyric poets esteemed by the scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria and yet his work attracted relatively little interest among ancient commentators, so that remarkably few fragments of his poetry now survive. As one scholar observed in 1967: "Time has dealt more harshly with Stesichorus than with any other major lyric poet." Recent discoveries, recorded on Egyptian papyrus (notably and controversially, the Lille Stesichorus), have led to some improvements in our understanding of his work, confirming his role as a link between Homer's epic narrative and the lyric narrative of poets like Pindar. The following description of the birthplace of the monster Geryon, preserved as a quote by the geographer Strabo, is characteristic of the "descriptive fulness" of his style: A nineteenth century translation imaginatively fills in the gaps while communicating something of the richness of the language: Stesichorus exercised an important influence on the representation of myth in 6th century art and on the development of Athenian dramatic poetry. Stesichorus was born in Metauros (modern Gioia Tauro) in Calabria, Southern Italy c. 630 BC and died in Katane (modern Catania) in Sicily in 555 BC. Some say that he came from Himera in Sicily, but that was due to him moving from Metauros to Himera later in life. When exiled from Pallantium in Arcadia he came to Katane (Catania) and when he died there was buried in front of the gate which is called Stesichorean after him. In date he was later than the lyric poet Alcman, since he was born in the 37th Olympiad (632/28 BC). He died in the 56th Olympiad (556/2 BC). He had a brother Mamertinus who was an expert in geometry and a second brother Helianax, a law-giver. He was a lyric poet. His poems are in the Doric dialect and in 26 books. They say that he was blinded for writing abuse of Helen and recovered his sight after writing an encomium of Helen, the Palinode, as the result of a dream. He was called Stesichorus because he was the first to establish ("stesai") a chorus of singers to the cithara; his name was originally Tisias. The specific dates given by the "Suda" for Stesichorus have been dismissed by one modern scholar as "specious precision" its dates for the "floruit" of Alcman (the 27th Olympiad), the life of Stesichorus (37th–56th Olympiads) and the birth of Simonides (the 56th Olympiad) virtually lay these three poets end-to-end, a coincidence that seems to underscore a convenient division between old and new styles of poetry. Nevertheless, the "Suda"'s dates "fit reasonably well" with other indications of Stesichorus's life-span for example, they are consistent with a claim elsewhere in "Suda" that the poet Sappho was his contemporary, along with Alcaeus and Pittacus, and also with the claim, attested by other sources, that Phalaris was his contemporary. Aristotle quoted a speech the poet is supposed to have made to the people of Himera warning them against the tyrannical ambitions of Phalaris. The Byzantine grammarian Tzetzes also listed him as a contemporary of the tyrant and yet made him a contemporary of the philosopher Pythagoras as well. According to Lucian, the poet lived to 85 years of age. Hieronymus declared that his poems became sweeter and more swan-like as he approached death, and Cicero knew of a bronzed statue representing him as a bent old man holding a book. Eusebius dated his "floruit" in Olympiad 42.2 (611/10 BC) and his death in Olympiad 55.1 (560/59 BC). The "Suda"'s claim that Hesiod was the father of Stesichorus can be dismissed as "fantasy" yet it is also mentioned by Tzetzes and the Hesiodic scholiast Proclus (one of them however named the mother of Stesichorus via Hesiod as Ctimene and the other as Clymene). According to another tradition known to Cicero, Stesichorus was the "grandson" of Hesiod yet even this verges on anachronism since Hesiod was composing verses around 700 BC. Stesichorus might be regarded as Hesiod's literary "heir" (his treatment of Helen in the Palinode, for example, may have owed much to Hesiod's "Catalogue of Women") and maybe this was the source of confusion about a family relationship. According to Stephanus of Byzantium and the philosopher Plato the poet's father was named Euphemus, but an inscription on a herm from Tivoli listed him as Euclides. The poet's mathematically inclined brother was named Mamertinus by the "Suda" but a scholiast in a commentary on Euclid named him Mamercus. Stesichorus's lyrical treatment of epic themes was well-suited to a western Greek audience, owing to the popularity of hero-cults in southern Italy and Magna Graeca, as for example the cult of Philoctetes at Sybaris, Diomedes at Thurii and the Atreidae at Tarentum. It was also a sympathetic environment for his most famous poem, The Palinode, composed in praise of Helen, an important cult figure in the Doric diaspora. On the other hand, the western Greeks were not very different from their eastern counterparts and his poetry cannot be regarded exclusively as a product of the Greek West . His poetry reveals both Doric and Ionian influences and this is consistent with the "Suda"'a claim that his birthplace was either Metauria or Himera, both of which were founded by colonists of mixed Ionian/Doric descent. On the other hand, a Doric/Ionian flavour was fashionable among later poets it is found in the 'choral' lyrics of the Ionian poets Simonides and Bacchylides and it might have been fashionable even in Stesichorus's own day. His poetry included a description of the river Himera as well as praise for the town named after it, and his poem "Geryoneis" included a description of Pallantium in Arcadia. His possible exile from Arcadia is attributed by one modern scholar to rivalry between Tegea and Sparta. Traditional accounts indicate that he was politically active in Magna Graeca. Aristotle mentions two public speeches by Stesichorus: one to the people of Himera, warning them against Phalaris, and another to the people of Locri, warning them against presumption (possibly referring to their war against Rhegium). Philodemus believed that the poet once stood between two armies (which two, he doesn't say) and reconciled them with a song but there is a similar story about Terpander. According to the 9th century scholar Photius, the term "eight all" (used by gamblers at dice) derives from an expensive burial the poet received outside Catana, including a monument with eight pillars, eight steps and eight corners, but the 3rd century grammarian Julius Pollux attributed the same term to an 'eight all ways' tomb given to the poet outside Himera. Many modern scholars don't accept the "Suda"'s claim that Stesichorus was named for his innovations in choral poetry there are good reasons to believe that his lyrical narratives were composed for solo performance (see Works below). Moreover the name wasn't unique there seems to have been more than one poet of this name (see Spurious works below). The "Suda" in yet another entry refers to the fact, now verified by Papyrus fragments, that Stesichorus composed verses in units of three stanzas (strophe, antistrophe and epode), a format later followed by poets such as Bacchylides and Pindar. "Suda" claims this three-stanza format was popularly referred to as "the three of Stesichorus" in a proverbial saying rebuking cultural buffoons ("You don't even know the three of Stesichorus!"). According to one modern scholar, however, this saying could instead refer to the following three lines of his poem "The Palinode", addressed to Helen of Troy: Helen of Troy's bad character was a common theme among poets such as Sappho and Alcaeus and, according to various ancient accounts, Stesichorus viewed her in the same light until she magically punished him with blindness for blaspheming her in one of his poems. According to a colourful account recorded by Pausanias, she later sent an explanation to Stesichorus via a man from Croton, who was on a pilgrimage to White Island in the Black Sea (near the mouth of the Blue Danube), and it was in response to this that Stesichorus composed the Palinode, absolving her of all blame for the Trojan War and thus restoring himself to full sight. The ancients associated the lyrical qualities of Stesichorus with the voice of the nightingale, as in this quote from the Palatine Anthology: ""...at his birth, when he had just reached the light of day, a nightingale, travelling through the air from somewhere or other, perched unnoticed on his lips and struck up her clear song."" The account is repeated by Pliny the Elder but it was the epic qualities of his work that most impressed ancient commentators, though with some reservations on the part of Quintillian: In a similar vein, Dionysius of Halicarnassus commends Stesichorus for ""...the magnificence of the settings of his subject matter; in them he has preserved the traits and reputations of his characters"", and Longinus puts him in select company with Herodotus, Archilochus and Plato as the 'most Homeric' of authors. Modern scholars tend to accept the general thrust of the ancient comments – even the 'fault' noted by Quintillian gets endorsement: 'longwindedness', as one modern scholar calls it, citing, as proof of it, the interval of 400 lines separating Geryon's death from his eloquent anticipation of it. Similarly, "the repetitiveness and slackness of the style" of the recently discovered Lille papyrus has even been interpreted by one modern scholar as proof of Stesichorean authorship – though others originally used it as an argument against. Possibly Stesichorus was even more Homeric than ancient commentators realized – they had assumed that he composed verses for performance by choirs (the triadic structure of the stanzas, comprising strophe, antistrophe and epode, is consistent with choreographed movement) but a poem such as the "Geryoneis" included some 1500 lines and it probably required about four hours to perform – longer than a chorus might reasonably be expected to dance. Moreover, the versatility of lyric meter is suited to solo performance with self-accompaniment on the lyre – which is how Homer himself delivered poetry. Whether or not it was a choral technique, the triadic structure of Stesichorean lyrics allowed for novel arrangements of dactylic meter – the dominant meter in his poems and also the defining meter of Homeric epic – thus allowing for Homeric phrasing to be adapted to new settings. However, Stesichorus did more than recast the form of epic poetry – works such as the "Palinode" were also a recasting of epic material: in that version of the Trojan War, the combatants fought over a phantom Helen while the real Helen either stayed home or went to Egypt (see a summarybelow). The 'Lyric Age' of Greece was in part self-discovery and self-expression – as in the works of Alcaeus and Sappho – but a concern for heroic values and epic themes still endured: The Homeric qualities of Stesichorus' poetry are demonstrated in a fragment of his poem "Geryoneis" describing the death of the monster Geryon. A scholiast writing in a margin on Hesiod's "Theogony" noted that Stesichorus gave the monster wings, six hands and six feet, whereas Hesiod himself had only described it as 'three-headed'. yet Stesichorus adapted Homeric motifs to create a humanized portrait of the monster, whose death in battle mirrors the death of Gorgythion in Homer's "Iliad", translated here by Richard Lattimore: Homer here transforms Gorgythion's death in battle into a thing of beautythe poppy has not wilted or died. Stesichorus adapted the simile to restore Death's ugliness while still retaining the poignancy of the moment: The mutual self-reflection of the two passages is part of the novel aesthetic experience that Stesichorus here puts into play. The enduring freshness of his art, in spite of its epic traditions, is borne out by Ammianus Marcellinus in an anecdote about Socrates: happening to overhear, on the eve of his own execution, the rendition of a song of Stesichorus, the old philosopher asked to be taught it: "So that I may know something more when I depart from life." See The Queen's Speech in the Lille fragment for more on Stesichorus's style. His works, according to the Suda, were collected in 26 books but each of these was probably a long, narrative poem. The titles of more than half of them are recorded by ancient sources: Some poems were wrongly attributed to Stesichorus by ancient sources, including bucolic poems and some love songs such as "Calyce" and "Rhadine". It is possible that these are the works of another Stesichorus belonging to the fourth century, mentioned in the Marmor Parium. Bovillae, about twelve miles outside Rome, was the original site of a monument dating from the Augustan period and now located in the Capitoline Museum. The stone monument features scenes from the fall of Troy, depicted in low relief, and an inscription: ('Sack of Troy according to Stesichorus'). Scholars are divided as to whether or not it accurately depicts incidents described by Stesichorus in his poem "Sack of Troy". There is, for example, a scene showing Aeneas and his father Anchises departing 'for Hesperia' with 'sacred objects', which might have more to do with the poetry of Virgil than with that of Stesichorus. </doc> <doc id="2341270" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341270" title="Eblen Center"> Eblen Center Hooper Eblen Center, often called The Hoop by students, is a 9,280 seat multi-purpose arena in on the campus of Tennessee Technological University (TTU) in Cookeville, Tennessee.

As Miss Mordaunt she had considerable experience, especially in Shakespearean leading parts, before her first London appearance in 1829 at Drury Lane as Widow Cheerly in Andrew Cherry's "The Soldier's Daughter". Her beauty and high spirits made her at once a popular favourite in a large number of comedy parts, until in 1831 she was married to Captain John Alexander Nisbett and retired. Her husband, however, was killed the same year by a fall from his horse, and she was compelled to reappear on the stage in 1832. She was the original Lady Gay Spanker of "London Assurance" (1841). In 1844 she withdrew again from the stage to marry Sir William Boothby, Bart., but on his death (1846), returned to play many parts, including Lady Teazle, Portia, and three dramatic parts created by Knowles: Constantine in the "Love Chase" and Helen and Julia in the "Hunchback". It was as Lady Teazle that she made her final appearance in 1851. </doc> <doc id="2341280" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341280" title="Bound &amp; Gagged (magazine)"> Bound &amp; Gagged (magazine) Bound & Gagged () magazine was published by the Outbound Press from 1987 to 2005.
