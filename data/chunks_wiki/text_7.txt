contract read that they were to be credited as producers on any product of theirs that came out,” Rogers recalls. “Brendan Cahill and I really did all the studio work and production with Lester Sill. When we finished the album, Lester said, ‘We’ll put you down as producers,’ but The Monkees didn’t want it, so that went by the wayside.” Davy Jones' Broadway rock, Michael Nesmith's country and western leanings and psychedelic experiments, and the rock and soul of Micky Dolenz made for a diverse album. Several of Peter Tork's compositions were considered for release on "Birds"; unfortunately however, they were all rejected (for reasons unknown). Aside from playing piano on "Daydream Believer," he did not participate in the making of the record at all. Veteran Monkees tunesmiths Boyce and Hart returned to the fold to contribute the psychedelic "P.O. Box 9847," as well as a new version of the aforementioned "Valleri." The rare U.S. mono album (COM-109) was released in a limited quantity, as mono albums were being phased out by 1968, and has become a highly sought item for its unique mixes that differ from the common stereo versions. Mono copies from Australia, India, Israel, Mexico and Puerto Rico are known to have the same mix as the U.S. There may be others as well. Most countries' mono versions — including the UK's — feature a "fold-down" mix where the stereo channels are reduced to one monaural channel (a mono version of the stereo mix). The front cover of the album shows a shadow box that contains some memorabilia from the 1940s through 1960s, including a Cootie bug, a popgun, a fan that folds out into a paper flower, ceramic birds, various paper flowers and stick flowers (which were popular in 1968). Alan Wolsky, whose agency created the cover, put a picture of himself in the bottom center square, partially obscured by some flowers. The rear cover contains the term "MIJACOGEO" alongside Micky's photo, a term that is an acronym for the members of Micky's family (Micky, Janelle, Coco and George, respectively). Another interesting quirk was that while Davy and Peter signed autographs in a traditional manner on their rear cover photos, Michael Nesmith signed "Carlisle Wheeling" to be superimposed onto his picture. This was the title of a song that did not make it on to any Monkees release at that time. However, it appeared on his post-Monkees album "Loose Salute" with the First National Band, having been renamed "Conversations". The song also was later released on various Monkees rarities collections. On February 8, 2010, Rhino Records' Rhino Handmade released a 3-CD boxed set reissue of the album. It was made available only online directly from Rhino. The set is housed in a 7 inch by 7 inch box with a 3D lenticular cover. It contains the original stereo and U.S. mono versions of the album in miniature vinyl replica sleeves, over 60 demos, rehearsals and outtakes from the original album's sessions, a commemorative pin and a booklet of essays and session information by Monkees historian Andrew Sandoval. The first 1,000 orders include a bonus vinyl single featuring two more unreleased tracks, acoustic versions of "St. Matthew" and "Lady's Baby". The mono mix was re-released on October 2014 by Friday Music, as part of "The Monkees in Mono" box set. This pressing features messages in the dead wax reading "Thanks to the Monkees" and "In memory of Davy Jones" on sides 1 and 2, respectively. The original track lineup for the album, compiled in March 1968, included the following songs: "Tracks 1-12: Original album in stereo" Bonus track Side 2, Track 7: "I'm Gonna Try" (prev. unissued)<br> Bonus track Side 2, Track 8: "P.O.

According to a report by the governor of the region Alonso de Contreras Guevara in 1582, the area was originally known as Guaraxambala, which signified the "Great Jaguar River." The original inhabitants of the municipio were the indigenous Lenca group. The first Spanish settled in ejidos established by the Lords Lucas, Manuel, Cristóbal, and Marcos Díaz, in the jurisdiction of Santiago. At this time, Feliciano del Cid of Trinidad de Jiquinlaca, Antonio Santiago of the jurisdiction of San Nicolás, Faustino López of the jurisdiction of San Miguel, and Juan Bernal de Rosa, were commissioned to survey the terrain of the new municipality. Concepción became a municipality in 1759, with the name of "Guarajambala". Two years later, the Spanish capitanía general in Guatemala designated it as a territory forming part of the circle of Camasca belonging to Gracias. In 1867, the municipality was renamed Zepeda y Zepeda. On 23 February 1904 the presidential administration of General Manuel Bonilla named the municipality Concepción and moved it into the Department of Intibucá These changes were instituted by act 440, which took effect on 1 December of that year. The municipality took the name of the patron saint of the municipality, the Virgin of Concepción. The municipality of Concepción has an area of . Concepción is located on the 14.03 parallel north latitude and 88.34 West longitude. Concepción is delimited to the north by the municipality of San Marco de Sierra, to the South and East by the municipality of Colomoncagua, to the West by the municipalities of Camasca and San Francisco. The municipality is connected by a road that extends Northeast for from Concepción to the departmental capital of La Esperanza. The road to La Esperanza is partially ballasted and partially paved and nearly always passable. Other roads continue to the Southwest to Camasca and Magdalena and to the Southeast to Olomoncaguua. A small network of roads access the aldeas around Concepción. These are passable primarily during the dry season. The rains sometimes make some of the surrounding roads impassible during the rainy season. The surrounding region is uneven as the municipality is surrounded by hills. The topography of Concepción an inclined plane from North to South to the shore of Río Negro (the Black River). The average elevation of the municipality is above sea level. Water resources include Río Negro and three smaller rivers — the San Juan, Santiago, and San Jerónimo — which drain into Río Negro. Rio Negro, also known locally as the Guarajambala, serves as the dividing line with the department of Lempira. Río Negro forms the Southern boundary of the municipality. Río Negro begins in the mountains of Colomoncagua and Santa Elena, La Paz and drains into the Lempa river basin, which flows into the Pacific Ocean. In Concepción Río Negro is used for artisanal fishing and the extraction of sand and gravel. It also provides a destination for domestic tourism. The San Juan River divides Concepción and the municipality of San Francisco, Lempira. It is exploited for artisanal fishing and as a source for sand. The Santiago River forms a small grassy plain that is good for grazing livestock. It is used for small scale irrigation and as a source for sand. The San Jerónimo River is used for artisanal fishing. Twenty six communities in Concepción have water sources. However, only 21 communities have water all year around. Sixteen of those have water from one of the four rivers that run through the municipality. Four communities only have water in the rainy season. The climate of this district is semitropical, with an average temperature that ranges between and degrees. The average annual precipitation in the municipality is to per year. The rainiest months are June to September and the dry months are from January to April. The dry season, referred to as summer, begins in late October or early November. Winds at this time of the year blow from Northeast to the Southeast. As the wind intensity increases, this period of winds dries the soils, interrupts electrical service, and affects crops and human health. Concepción has 10,605 inhabitants. Of these 5,272 are men or boys and 5,333 are women or girls. The majority of the population 5,530 (52.1%) are 17 years old or younger, 4,480 (42.2%) are ages 18–64, and 595 (5.6%) are 65 or older. The population density of the municipality of Concepción is equivalent to 115.5 people per square km (10,605 Inhabitants / 91.82 km). The municipal of Concepción is split among 9 aldeas (villages) and 57 caseríos (hamlets). </doc> <doc id="2343311" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343311" title="Dolores, Intibucá"> Dolores, Intibucá Dolores is a municipality in the Honduran department of Intibucá. </doc> <doc id="2343314" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343314" title="Jesús de Otoro"> Jesús de Otoro Jesús de Otoro is a municipality in the Honduran department of Intibucá.

The main coffee cooperatives are FUNDECASA producing Rain Forest Alliance Coffee and COARENE producing Fairtrade Fairtrade and Organic Coffee. The natural beauty and climate of the area is unparalleled in Honduras. The Opalaca Biological Reserve looms in the background and numerous creeks flow through the valley. Due to the attractions in the area, a community group of leaders have established the first Rural Tourism Cooperative in the country, offering various packages for tourists wanting to see what they call "the Real Honduras". This is a rural, picturesque community with not only natural attractions such as waterfalls, cloud forests, and canyons but also unique because of the community spirit and active participation of local leaders trying to promote eco-tourism. The cooperative consists of a united group of guides, comedores (cafeterias), guest house owners, horse owners, site owners, and a visitor's center run by native Gladys Nolasco. The best local home cooked hardy food is Comdedor Paty located behind the police station and frequented by workers and locals alike. Guided tours are offered on horseback and community members have also been trained to give coffee roasting demonstrations, local artisan workshops, and sugar cane production demonstrations.

It was authorized on January 29, 1813, and recruited in East by Col. Williams Tennessee. It was commanded by Colonel John Williams, who had previously led the Mounted Volunteers of East Tennessee. On December 31, 1813 Major-General Thomas Pinckney ordered the regiment to join Andrew Jackson's force countermanding orders that had been sent from General Flournoy at New Orleans who wanted them there, thus providing a disciplined core and strategic resupply for his command which was down to about 75 men eating roots and acorns. The historian Henry Adams speculated that, without this regiment, Jackson would have fared no better in 1814 than he had the previous year. Jackson welcomed the 39th. Since the beginning of his campaign in the Creek War, Jackson was troubled by serious discipline problems with his militia and volunteers, particularly the militia from East Tennessee. So he prosecuted a Private John Woods, only 18 under false charges. Woods had spent his last month in the camp of the 39th. The night before his execution the officers of the 39th signed and sent Jackson a petition asking for mercy. He not only failed to grant it, he made the 39th shoot him. He told his quartermaster that "I am truly happy in having the Colonel with me. His regiment will give strength to my arm and quell mutiny". The 39th was never happy with Jackson after that and Col. Williams never returned to lead the unit. Williams said in a campaign pamphlet in 1828 that Woods cried "bitterly and loudly"; the Jackson camp claimed he was belligerent and deserved to die. At the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Jackson placed the regiment, (because they were the best-trained soldiers he had) in the center of his assault force. Consequently, the 39th suffered significant casualties — 20 killed and 52 wounded, and those figures are disputed. Col. Williams reported to Sec. of War Armstrong that "one half of the officers and one sixth of the troops of the 39th engaged in the battle of Tohopeka are among the killed and wounded. The officers remaining with the regiment fit for duty are insufficient for ordinary camp duty." It is said that the Creek nation lost more casualties that day than any other one day in the history of the entire Indian Wars. They gave up over a million acres of what was described as the "best land for settlement" that was left east of the Mississippi River. In 1815, after that war ended, the 39th was consolidated with the 8th and 24th Regiments to form the 7th Infantry Regiment. The Flag of the 39th was returned to Col. Williams and is now on display at the East Tennessee History Center in Knoxville. It was embroidered by the handiwork of Col. Williams' sister-in-law, Mary (Polly) Lawson McClung Williams. </doc> <doc id="2343348" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343348" title="International Programme for Antarctic Buoys"> International Programme for Antarctic Buoys The International Programme for Antarctic Buoys (IPAB) is a component of the WCRP.

With Liu Fei's death in 189 BC, Emperor Hui allowed Liu Xiang to inherit the title of "Prince of Qi". During the Lü Clan Disturbance, Liu Xiang led the Qi forces and also seized the forces of the nearby Principality of Langye, and was ready to march to the capital Chang'an to claim the imperial throne for himself, assisted by his brothers Liu Zhang and Liu Xingju.

She wrote a regular column on IF for "Rock, Paper, Shotgun". A number of Short's works have won acclaim at the XYZZY Awards, an annual popular-choice award for interactive fiction. Her work has been described by reviewers in terms that range from "mesmerizing" to "frustrating". Her 2003 work "City of Secrets" was originally commissioned by a San Francisco synth-pop band, but after they left the project, she completed it on her own. While many of Short's early games were written in Inform, she later experimented with a variety of formats. One such format was Versu, an engine for plot-heavy and story-rich interactive fiction that Short helped develop, and which was later scrapped by Linden Labs, the company owning the engine. Other formats include Varytale, for which she developed the game "Bee", and a custom engine by Liza Daly (with help from the company inkle) for the game "First Draft of the Revolution". Both formats use an interactive fiction engine based on hyperlinks. Short has played a major role in the development of Graham Nelson's radical new interactive fiction development system, Inform 7. Her more conspicuous contributions include writing most of the 300+ programming examples in the documentation, and creating two full-length demo games for release with the Inform 7 beta. </doc> <doc id="2343438" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343438" title="Head (The Monkees album)"> Head (The Monkees album) Head is the soundtrack to the film "Head", the only theatrical release by The Monkees. Released in 1968 through Colgems, it was the band's sixth album. "Head" was the last Monkees album to feature Peter Tork until "Pool It!" in 1987 and the last to feature all four Monkees until 1996's "Justus". The soundtrack album intersperses the six full-length songs ("Porpoise Song", "Circle Sky", "Can You Dig It?", "As We Go Along", "Daddy's Song" and "Long Title: Do I Have to Do This All Over Again?") with bits of Ken Thorne's incidental music, dialogue fragments, and sound effects culled from the film. The selection of music and dialogue approximates the flow of the movie itself, and was compiled by actor Jack Nicholson, who co-wrote the film's shooting script. In 2013, "Rolling Stone" ranked the album at number 25 in their list of "The 25 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time". The music of The Monkees often featured rather dark subject matter beneath a superficially bright, uplifting sound. The music of the film takes the darkness and occasional satirical elements of the Monkees' earlier tunes and makes it far more overt, as in "Ditty Diego/War Chant", or "Daddy's Song", which has Jones singing an upbeat, Broadway-style number about a boy abandoned by his father. In his 2012 essay on the soundtrack album, academic Peter Mills observed that "on this album the songs are only part of the story, as they were with The Monkees project as a whole: signals, sounds, and ideas interfere with each other throughout." The original issue of the record (Colgems #COSO-5008) featured a front cover with a surface of aluminized PET film, meant to reflect the listener's "head" (face) back at them. With the movie having only a limited release (and virtually no publicity), the point was largely lost, and while the cover was innovative for its time, manufacturing was problematic. (Micky Dolenz recalled years later that the cover was ruining the printing presses at RCA.) A March 1985 LP reissue from Rhino Records (RNLP-145) was less problematic by using foil paper instead, the result being less reflective than the original. The Rhino CD reissue from 1994 (R2-71795) has a grey cover that is not reflective at all. "Tracks 1-14: Original album" On October 26, 2010, Rhino Records released a three-disc deluxe box set through its Rhino Handmade division. Along with the three discs, the set contained a 27-page booklet and a bonus 7" record that includes unreleased instrumental versions of "Porpoise Song" and ‚"As We Go Along." "Tracks 1-14: Original album in stereo" The front cover of the box also features an authentic reproduction of the album's original front cover, printed on foil mylar to reflect the person's head.

Based in Las Vegas, Nevada, it serves about 1.3 million customers and over 40 million tourists annually. MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company (now Berkshire Hathaway Energy), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, acquired NV Energy in a transaction completed on December 19, 2013. NV Energy will continue to be based in Las Vegas under its current name. Prior to the acquisition by MidAmerican, the company's common stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NVE. NV Energy is the product of the 1998 merger of the two major utilities in Nevada—northern Nevada's Sierra Pacific Power, based in Reno, and Las Vegas' Nevada Power. Sierra Pacific Power was founded in 1928 from a merger of several companies dating back to the gold rush of the 1850s. In 1984, it reorganized as a holding company, Sierra Pacific Resources. Nevada Power was formed in 1906 as the Consolidated Power and Telephone Company of Nevada. It sold off its telephone operations in 1929 and became Southern Nevada Power, changing its name to Nevada Power in 1961. A year later, it became the first Nevada-based company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power merged. Sierra Pacific Resources was the nominal survivor, with Nevada Power joining Sierra Pacific Power as one of its operating companies. However, headquarters moved from Reno to Nevada Power's old campus in Las Vegas. The merger created a company with a service territory stretching over 44,400 square miles—nearly all of Nevada's densely populated area. On September 22, 2008, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power began doing business as NV Energy. This is the result of the corporate decision to unify its image under a single brand. Later, Sierra Pacific Resources changed its corporate name to NV Energy, Inc. In 2009, NV Energy sold its California operations to a partnership of Algonquin Power & Utilities and Emera. Algonquin later bought out Emera. In February 2010, NV Energy entered a 20-year agreement with Pattern Energy to be the sole purchaser of power generated by Pattern's Spring Valley Wind Farm, which opened in August 2012. The wind farm generates power for NV Energy customers in northern Nevada and the Las Vegas Valley. Based on the reliability of electric distribution service, NV Energy ranked among the best 10% of electric utilities nationwide in 2012, 2011 and 2010, and was the best in the nation in 2009. The rankings are based on interruption frequency and interruption duration compared to a peer group constructed by the Edison Electric Institute. NV Energy has recently made a number of customer service improvements, including online access to account and energy use information https://nvenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8838&item=136899, revamping its IVR system and providing 24/7 customer service https://nvenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8838&item=136905. The company serves its customers through a variety of sources including natural gas and renewable energy. The company is currently exceeding Nevada's renewable portfolio standard https://nvenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8838&item=136908, of 18 percent of its total energy sales. NV Energy’s northern Nevada operating company achieved a 33.6 percent renewable energy and renewable energy credit level, and southern Nevada achieved a 20.2 percent renewable portfolio standard. - See more at: https://nvenergy.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=8838&item=136908#sthash.79PdPI85.dpuf In 2006, the company announced plans to construct the Ely Energy Center near Ely, Nevada. The project would initially consist of two 750 megawatt pulverized coal generation units, but was delayed for approximately 10 years in February 2009. In May 2011, the company completed construction of the Harry Allen gas-fired generating plant below budget and ahead of schedule. Prior to 2013, the company's northern and southern Nevada electric grids were not connected, and ran as separate systems. This changed in late 2013, when the company completed a transmission line running from the Harry Allen plant north to Ely, Nevada. The 500-kilovolt One Nevada Transmission Line (ONLine) is expected to improve electric service reliability, reduce costs and allow development of renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and geothermal generating units, in remote parts of the state. NV Energy buys solar power from the 100 MW Playa Solar 2 project at $0.0378/kWh in a 20-year power purchase agreement. </doc> <doc id="2343443" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343443" title="Kanno"> Kanno Kanno may refer to: Kannō (with a macron) may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2343444" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343444" title="List of field marshals of the Holy Roman Empire"> List of field marshals of the Holy Roman Empire This is a list of those who were granted the rank of "Feldmarschall" by the Holy Roman Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, 1618–1806. </doc> <doc id="2343451" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343451" title="Shushan, New York"> Shushan, New York Shushan is a hamlet in the town of Salem in Washington County, New York, United States.

The city is sometimes dubbed "the City of a Thousand Pesantrens" for its abundance of Islamic boarding schools. Located around southeast from the provincial capital of Bandung, Tasikmalaya is passed by Indonesian National Route 3. The city is located in the mountainous Preanger region of Java at an elevation of 351 metres (1,151 feet). The population of the city (excluding the Tasikmalaya Regency, which surrounds the city to the west, south and east) was 635,464 according to the 2010 Census, the latest official (as at 2015) is 808,506. Its built-up ("or metro") area made of Tasikmalaya City and 14 districts spread on Tasikmalaya and Ciamis regencies was home to 1,339,891 inhabitants as of 2010 census. The population of the city Tasikmalaya according to the census in the year 2005 was 579.671 people, and in 2010 increased to 635.464. For the latest data population of the city increased to 808.506 people in 2015. The city of Tasikmalaya was the site of a widely reported riot in late December 1996. Four people were killed and several churches and dozens of mostly Chinese-owned businesses were destroyed in the violence, which was triggered by allegations of police brutality. It was also fueled by frustration with allegedly corrupt local government officials. The event was among the earliest of many riots with religion- and class-based undertones that occurred in Java during the late 1990s. On 5 April 1982, the volcano of Gunung Galunggung erupted about 24 km from the city, causing major damage through lahar and ash projection, and forcing a temporary evacuation of the area. On 2 September 2009 a magnitude 7 earthquake struck, destroying a number of buildings in the city and killing several people. On 26 June 2010, a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck Tasikmalaya at 4:45pm Waktu Indonesia Barat (WIB). No injuries or destroyed buildings were reported. On 20 May 2012, a magnitude 5 earthquake struck. It happened at 07:37pm Waktu Indonesia Barat (WIB). No injuries or destroyed buildings were reported.

It was recorded and produced by the band and Tom Tatman at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and was released on August 27, 2002, through Roadrunner Records. Writing for the album began in 2000 while vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarist Jim Root were still actively involved in their other band, Slipknot. Work began on the album after Slipknot had gone on hiatus following touring in support of their second album "Iowa". Following the release of the album, Stone Sour went on to promote it for almost a year; releasing three singles and touring in several regions, including the United States and several countries in Europe. The album received generally positive reviews. It was praised for showing a diversity in Taylor's vocals, which was not presented in Slipknot's early albums. It was also certified Gold in the United States and two singles from the album received Grammy Award nominations for Best Metal Performance in consecutive years. In 2000, Josh Rand contacted Corey Taylor after Taylor had returned from touring in Japan with his other band Slipknot about material he had been working on. Speaking about the experience, Taylor said, "we just started writing stuff and it started to happen". The duo wrote 14 songs and began working in a studio on some demos. Taylor added that it got to a point where he said to Rand, "I think we're going to have to put a real band together, because this is just too serious!" After further enlisting the help of Joel Ekman and previous Stone Sour members Shawn Economaki and Jim Root, the band began working on the album at Catamount Studios in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Before the release of the album, the band went through several different names, most notably Superego, before later announcing that they would use their original name Stone Sour. Prior to the release of the album, the track "Bother" was featured on the soundtrack for the film "Spider-Man"; however, it was only credited to Corey Taylor. In support of the album, Stone Sour released two singles in quick succession; "Get Inside" was the band's first music video and it included live footage. Released shortly after, "Bother" also featured a music video. Throughout October and November 2002, Stone Sour toured the United States in support of the album with Chevelle and Sinch. In 2003, the band continued to tour in support of the album; including a European tour with Saliva, an American tour with Powerman 5000, several appearances at European festivals, a UK tour with Murderdolls, amongst others. The third single from the album, "Inhale," was released in early 2003, shortly after the previously unreleased track "Inside the Cynic" was featured on the soundtrack for "Freddy vs. Jason". On October 21, 2003, a special edition version of "Stone Sour" was released which included "Inside the Cynic", four additional unreleased tracks, a DVD which featured all three music videos and alternative cover artwork. Corey Taylor touted "Stone Sour" as "melodic hard rock with content and initiative." Jason D. Taylor of Allmusic noted that although it is not displayed on early Slipknot releases, "[Corey] Taylor has the ability to actually sing," citing Alice in Chains and Soundgarden as influences. Jason Taylor went on to state the album gets better after multiple listens. Jeff Modzelewski of "411mania" wrote the album mixed "hostility, reservation, brutality and melody." According to Modzelewski, the album has a "mainstream sound" with each of the band's members standing out during one song or another. Don Kaye of Blabbermouth.net felt the message of "Bother" did not differ from Slipknot tracks, but was "presented in an utterly different musical vein". Kaye also felt the album "holds its own ... in terms of heaviness and power." "The band knows how to put together an energetic rocker," wrote "NY Rock"; elements such as the "melodic twist to the songs ... will please hardcore and metal fans." "Stone Sour" received generally positive reviews. Most reviewers offered some comparison to that of vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root's other band Slipknot. While reviewing the album, Don Kaye wrote that "it's rare that a musician offers up another venue for their talents that proves to be equal to their fulltime outfit," stating that Stone Sour is one such case. While Rowan Shaeffer of "Counterculture" states that "Get Inside" is "the closest to Slipknot that Stone Sour get," even comparing it to the Slipknot single "Left Behind". Citing "the chugging rhythm, manic kick-drums and shout-along vocals" as specific elements that are reminiscent of Slipknot, adding that it was "an obvious choice for a single" as it would not alienate their potential audience of Slipknot fans. Jason D. Taylor noted the similarity in lyrical content to that of Slipknot's; however, he stated that vocalist Taylor comes across as less infuriated which "allows the songs themselves to settle smoothly, yet motivate the listener to feel the emotion". "NY Rock" stated that the album has a "more balanced feel to it" than that of Slipknot's most recent release at that time, "Iowa". Reviewers also noted upon the album's versatility, specifically that of Taylor's vocal range and abilities. Jeff Modzelewski praised the opening track "Get Inside" explaining, "the scorching speed-metal verse and screaming chorus are played off pretty well against the melodic pre-chorus". Jason D. Taylor cited "Orchids" and "Take a Number" as songs which stand out because they "strike with surprising force for an alternative rock group". On a similar note, Don Kaye said the album includes some "sinister, groove-oriented metal gems that refreshingly stay away from nu metal cliches". The most melodic track on the album, "Bother", received specific attention from most reviewers. Modzelewski said that the track "seems to be the song that the album has been preparing everyone for", further adding that Taylor proves "that he is a legitimate vocalist who doesn't need to rely on destroying his vocal chords to make a good song". In his review, Rowan Shaeffer stated the track was a specific highlight, but said that the change in style was "at odds with the rest of the material" on the album. In 2003, Stone Sour's first single from the album, "Get Inside", was nominated for the Best Metal performance at the 45th Grammy Awards. On March 20, 2003, "Stone Sour" was certified Gold in the United States. The following year, the album's third single, "Inhale", was also nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 46th Grammy Awards.

HaMoked states that it works for the enforcement of the standards and values of international human rights and humanitarian law. According to Israel's Justice Minister, Ayelet Shaked, HaMoked engages in "apartheid rhetoric" and supports what she described as the anti-Israel boycott movement Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions. HaMoked's aims, as registered with Israel's Registrar of Non-profit Organizations, are to: "Provide assistance to persons who have fallen victim to acts of violence, abuse or deprivation of basic rights by governmental authorities (including local government), especially those needing assistance in conveying their complaints to these authorities, and also to protect basic rights in any other manner, including application to legal instances and among them - petitions to the Supreme Court of Israel in its capacity as High Court of Justice, whether in the name of an individual who claims that his basic right was harmed and whether as a "friend of the court." As Palestinians from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem turned to HaMoked with additional issues, the organization expanded its activities to handle human rights violations in other spheres as well. These include Detainee Rights; Residency Rights and Family Unification; Freedom of Movement; Violence by security forces and settlers toward Palestinians; and Punitive House Demolition. HaMoked also operates an Emergency Human Rights Hotline in order to attempt to offer real time solutions by working vis-a-vis relevant authorities in the field. Emergency situations include those arising from restrictions on movement within the territories; from violence; from delays in the evacuation of the injured, the sick, and women in labor; and from the blockage of humanitarian aid such as food, medicine and water. HaMoked provide case commentaries in the "Court Watch" section of their website where they present "judicial critiques of judgment rendered by the HCJ and other Courts, in light of human rights standards." In 2006, HaMoked filed a lawsuit at the Jerusalem Magistrate's Court on behalf of a resident of East Jerusalem against the State of Israel for "alleged repeated arrests by the police and Shin Bet security service, unnecessary delays at checkpoints and abusive interrogations between 1996-1999". The state attorney from the Tel Aviv prosecutor's office for civil matters submitted an official statement to the court that accused HaMoked and B'Tselem of being organizations that "undermine the existence" of Israel, "besmirch" Israel and its security forces, and "cause it damage in the world" adding that HaMoked "does not deal with 'defending human rights' as it claims, but instead with defending the rights of Palestinians only" and that its "self-presentation as 'a human rights organization' has no basis in reality and is designed to mislead". HaMoked's director filed a complaint with the Attorney General and said that the state's document contained "unbridled attacks" on both organizations and on "the very notion of defending the human rights of Palestinians" adding that "Attacks by the state on human rights organizations active in it and on the sheer legitimacy of their existence pose a serious threat to democratic rule". HaMoked demanded that a revised statement be filed by the state. The state attorney's statements received support from Gerald M. Steinberg of NGO Monitor and were criticized by Israeli historian and writer Tom Segev, the New Israel Fund, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and Israeli politician Zehava Gal-On. Israel's State Prosecutor's Office dissociated itself from the state attorney's comments, and said they "reflect neither the prosecution's position nor the position of the state, and were not authorized" and that the "state's position has been and continues to be that HaMoked: Center for the Defense of the Individual and the B'Tselem organization are human rights organizations". They confirmed that what they described as "inappropriate" comments would be excised and a revised version would be submitted to the court. In March 2010, HaMoked was one of ten human rights organizations that co-signed a letter to Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak. The letter demanded a delay to the implementation of military orders, with prevention of infiltration and security provisions that, according to the NGO, authorized the Israeli army to deport Palestinian residents from the West Bank if they do not have an Israeli permit. An Israeli permit is a new requirement for the majority of Palestinians in the West Bank. Military Order No. 1650 is an amendment to a 1969 military law intended to deal with infiltration from neighboring Arab countries. According to the NGO, a Palestinian without a permit will be classified as an "infiltrator". Israeli security sources have stated that the new edict is designed to allow for judicial oversight of the expulsion of an individual under the order. In 2011, following a request submitted by HaMoked under Israel's Freedom of Information Law, the legal advisor for the Judea and Samaria Justice Ministry's office provided a document that described a covert procedure that Israel used to cancel the residency status of 140,000 Palestinian residents of the West Bank who traveled abroad such as students who studied at foreign universities and people who migrated internationally for work. The procedure was used from the 1967 occupation of the West Bank until the Oslo Accords were signed in 1994. Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories between 1991 and 1995, Daniel Rothschild, said he was not aware of the procedure and that "one may infer that neither were residents of the occupied territories". HaMoked said that "mass withdrawal of residency rights from tens of thousands of West Bank residents, tantamount to permanent exile from their homeland, remains an illegitimate demographic policy and a grave violation of international law." According to organization, the number of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip who lost their residency rights is unknown. According to the JTA, HaMoked received US$300,000 from the Ford Foundation in 2002. HaMoked received "at least 8,500,000 NIS in European funding" from 2006-2009. According to a 2011 article in The Forward, HaMoked received, in 2009, $300,000 from the "Ramallah-based NGO Development Center (NDC)" which in turn, had received funding from the "Geneva-headquartered Welfare Association." In 2010, HaMoked also received 25,000 Euros from the Finnish government. Gerald M. Steinberg has criticized Hamoked that it does not promote dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians by publishing political statements. </doc> <doc id="2343490" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343490" title="List of historical secret police organizations"> List of historical secret police organizations This is a list of historical secret police organizations.

Global One Lending follows a multi-level marketing (MLM) business model. New loan agents are recruited by existing agents. As is typical of MLM-based businesses, all agents earn a commission (of 36% or more of the gross profits) on loans completed, and a smaller commission for loans completed by agents they've recruited. There are several different ranks within the Global One hierarchy. Beneath the two founders are a group of managers, who in turn have their own group of supervisors, who are generally responsible for managing the new recruits directly. Agents achieve higher ranks based on the number of loans closed and the number of new recruits. Global One president Robert Do founded Global One Lending as an extension of his small local real estate brokerage.

He played as a shortstop in Major League Baseball, most notably for the Minnesota Twins. He was the catalyst who led the 1965 Twins to their first World Series after moving from Washington to Minnesota. The same year he also won the American League Most Valuable Player award. Versalles was born in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba and he had difficulty adjusting to life in the U.S., due largely to the language barrier and his fear of failure, leaving him eternally homesick for his native Cuba. Versalles was signed as an amateur free agent by the Washington Senators prior to the 1958 season and was assigned to the Elmira Pioneers in the Class D New York–Penn League where he held his own and hit .292 in 124 games. The following spring, he went north with the Senators and made his major league debut on 1 August 1959. However, he was obviously overmatched and after hitting .153 with 15 strikeouts in 59 at-bats, Versalles was sent back down and spent the rest of the season with the Fox Cities Foxes in the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, hitting .278 with 9 home runs. In 1960 Versalles split time between Washington and AAA Charleston trying to grow as a player and work through a stereotype that he was too sure of himself and was thus incapable of taking instruction. Although he hit .278 at Charleston with 8 home runs, 50 RBI and 24 stolen bases, he committed 42 errors and had only a .940 fielding percentage. In 1961, the year the Senators moved to Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota to become the Minnesota Twins, Versalles came to the majors to stay. Although his glove continued to be average at best, Versalles hit well enough to stay in the lineup, finishing the season with a .280 average, 7 home runs, 53 RBI and 16 stolen bases. Versalles' 1961 Topps card (#21) actually listed his first name as ″Zorro″, a nickname frequently used early in his career by media, fans and even club officials. The following season, Versalles played in 160 games and despite his batting average dropping to .240, he hit 17 home runs (third most for American League shortstops behind Detroit Tiger Chico Fernandez and New York Yankee Tom Tresh who both hit 20) and 67 RBI. Versalles led the league in assists with 501 and lowered his errors from 30 to 26, and got a smattering of MVP votes (finishing 21st). In 1963, Versalles raised his batting average to .261 and led the league in triples (13) and was voted to his first All-Star team. Starting in the July 9 game, Versalles singled and was hit by a pitch in two plate appearances before being lifted for Chicago White Sox shortstop Luis Aparicio. Although Versalles received his first Gold Glove award in 1963, he was still erratic in the field as his five errors in a July 5 double header against the Baltimore Orioles and season total of 30 errors attests. In 1964, Versalles had another solid season, hitting .259 with 20 home runs (second for AL shortstops behind Detroit's Dick McAuliffe), 64 RBI, and 14 stolen bases and again led the league in triples with 10. Under the tutelage of Twins' third base coach Billy Martin, Versalles put it all together during his 1965 MVP season and led the American League in plate appearances (728), at-bats (666), runs scored (126), doubles (45), triples (12), extra-base hits (76) and total bases (308), and was second in assists (487) and third in stolen bases (27). He was a near-unanimous winner of the MVP award, receiving 19 of 20 first-place votes. The remaining first-place vote went to teammate and fellow Cuban Tony Oliva. He also led the league and set career highs in both strikeouts (122) and errors (39), which underlined his career-long struggles both at the plate and in the field in these areas. Versalles was named to his second All-Star team for the July 13 game (played in his home park, Bloomington, Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium) along with five fellow Twins (first baseman Harmon Killebrew, catcher Earl Battey, pitcher Mudcat Grant and outfielders Jimmie Hall and Tony Oliva), but went hitless with a walk in two plate appearances after subbing for starter Dick McAuliffe in the sixth inning. Before the World Series began, Versalles was pictured on the cover of the October 4 issue of "Sports Illustrated" and was featured in the article which discussed the Twins' chances against possible National League opponents. In the Series against the NL champion Los Angeles Dodgers, Versalles started all seven games, hit .286 with his only home run and all four RBI coming in the lopsided Game 1 win, but it was not enough as the Twins lost to the Dodgers four games to three. Following his MVP and World Series runner-up season, the team gave Versalles a raise to $40,000 annually. His performance almost immediately declined, as he hit only .249 in 137 games with an across-the-board drop in his offensive production. Despite this, he continued to have memorable moments such as on June 9, in the seventh inning of a game against the Kansas City Athletics. Versalles was one of five Twins players to hit home runs (along with Killebrew, Don Mincher, Oliva and Rich Rollins). These five home runs still stand as a major league record for the most home runs in a single inning. In July, he was treated for a hematoma in his back which put him on the disabled list for a short time, cost him playing time the following season, and led to a lifelong condition. Following his continuing struggles at the plate, which only accented his inconsistent glove (leading the American League in errors 1965–1967), the Twins finally parted ways on November 27, 1967 when he was traded to the Dodgers along with starting pitcher Mudcat Grant for relievers Bob Miller and Ron Perranoski and veteran catcher Johnny Roseboro. After one season with the Dodgers, in which he finished fourth in league in errors and hit only .196, he was exposed to the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft and was the 10th selection of the San Diego Padres. He never suited up for the expansion Padres as he was sent to the Cleveland Indians on December 2 to complete an October 29 trade that sent first baseman Bill Davis to San Diego. Improving slightly over his previous year at the plate, Versalles was hitting .226 in 72 games when on July 26, 1969, he was purchased by the new Washington Senators. With this trade, Versalles became one of only nine players to don the uniforms of both the original and expansion Senators teams, with the others being Don Mincher, Camilo Pascual, Pedro Ramos, Johnny Schaive, Roy Sievers, Hal Woodeshick, Rudy Hernández, and Héctor Maestri. Although he hit .267 in limited action with the Senators and was invited back for spring training in 1970, he was released on April 6. Following a year playing in the Mexican League for Gómez Palacio, he was purchased by the Atlanta Braves on May 31, 1972 and he finished his major league career hitting .191 in 66 games. After being released by the Braves in December, he played in Japan in 1972 for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp. For his career, Versalles had a batting average of .242 (.252 during his six years with the Twins) with 1,046 hits, 564 runs, 86 homers, 401 RBI, and 84 stolen bases in 1,065 games. During his five-year peak (1961–1965), Versalles led all AL shortstops with 73 home runs. Baseball statistician/historian Bill James points out that Versalles' MVP season makes him the player with the fewest career win shares (134) to win an MVP award. While it may be true that Versalles could be considered a one-year MVP flash in the pan, he led the league in multiple offensive categories and was a near-unanimous selection. He also led the league in VORP (52.4), a stat that more accurately measures a player's overall production, and WAR (7.6), which includes a player's defensive value with his offensive production. At the time, most of the talk was not about whether or not he was deserving of the MVP, but whether teammate Tony Oliva should actually have been the winner. Oliva's .321 batting average and 98 RBI were much higher, his strikeouts were less than half, and his home run and stolen base totals nearly equaled Versalles. Versalles went down in history as the first Latin American player to be named most valuable player and he is one of only five Twins to win the MVP (along with teammate Killebrew, Rod Carew, and more recent Twins Joe Mauer and Justin Morneau) and one of only three Twins to top the league in WAR (along with Carew and Mauer). Versalles returned to the Minneapolis area following his year in Japan, but found it virtually impossible to make a living, partly because he had never learned English and partly because of the lingering effects of a back injury he had suffered while running out a ground ball with the Dodgers in 1968. Holding a series of menial jobs, he lost his house to foreclosure and was eventually forced to sell his MVP trophy, his All-Star rings and his Gold Gloves. In addition to his back problems he suffered two heart attacks, underwent stomach surgery and was sustained solely by disability and Social Security payments. He was found dead in his home in Bloomington, Minnesota on June 11, 1995. An autopsy revealed that Versalles died from arteriosclerotic heart disease or hardening of the arteries. Versalles was survived by his wife Maria, six daughters and several grandchildren. Versalles was elected to the Twins Hall of Fame in 2006. </doc> <doc id="2343505" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343505" title="Eddi Reader"> Eddi Reader Sadenia "Eddi" Reader MBE (born 29 August 1959) is a Scottish singer-songwriter, known both for her work with Fairground Attraction and for an enduring solo career. She is the recipient of three BRIT Awards and has topped both the album and singles charts. In 2003, she showcased the works of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns. Reader was born in Glasgow, the daughter of a welder, and the eldest of seven children (her brother, Francis, is vocalist with the band The Trash Can Sinatras). She was nicknamed Edna by her parents. Living at first in the district of Anderston, Glasgow, in a tenement slum demolished in 1965, the young Reader family moved to a two-bedroomed flat in the estate of Arden, Glasgow. In 1976, due to overcrowding the family was re-housed 25 miles from Glasgow, in a council development in Irvine, North Ayrshire, however Eddi returned to Glasgow (where she lived with her grandmother) to finish her compulsory schooling. She began playing the guitar at the age of ten, and started her musical career busking, first in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street, then in the early 1980s in London and around Europe (where she also worked with circus and performance artists). Back in Scotland, while finding factory work in Irvine and working part-time in Sirocco Recording Studio in Kilmarnock, she answered an advert in the music press and travelled to London to audition and join the punk band Gang of Four, who needed a backing singer for their appearance on British television music show "The Old Grey Whistle Test" and for their UK tour. This led to her first US tour with the band. After returning to the UK and leaving the band, she started working as a session vocalist in London, picking up work singing jingles for radio advertisements and singing with such acts as Eurythmics, The Waterboys, Billy MacKenzie, John Foxx and Alison Moyet. In 1984, Reader returned to the UK from Paris, where she had been working as a singer for the composer Vladimir Cosma. Through her contact with the brass section session players The Kick Horns in London, she signed a contract with EMI, and recorded two singles with the disco group Outbar Squeek. Around the same time, she met and asked Mark E. Nevin, a guitarist and songwriter from the band Jane Aire and the Belvederes to write for her and they recorded two songs as "The Academy of Fine Popular Music". They subsequently formed Fairground Attraction, together with Simon Edwards (guitarrón – a Mexican acoustic bass guitar) and Roy Dodds (drums & percussion). In 1988 the band signed to RCA/BMG records and released their first single, "Perfect", which became a UK number one, winning best single at the 1989 BRIT Awards. Their first album, "The First of a Million Kisses", was also a success, reaching number two in the UK Albums Chart, and winning best album at the 1989 Brits. This success was short-lived, however. In November 1989, after a break, during which Reader had her first child, Charlie, with her French-Algerian partner Milou, arguments arose within the group, and Nevin abandoned a recording session for the second album, which eventually led to the splitting of the band. A makeshift second album, a collection of B-sides and live tracks, "Ay Fond Kiss", was rushed out the following year. Reader returned to Scotland, but before she embarked on her solo career she took a temporary detour into acting. She played Jolene Jowett, a singer and accordionist, in John Byrne's "Your Cheatin' Heart", a comedy-drama series for BBC Television, set in the country music scene in Scotland. In 1993 Reader was the presenter of BBC Scotland's No Stilettos, a music performance programme recorded in Glasgow. Her other acting credits include playing the part of "Joy 3" from the Michael Boyd (artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company) production of Janice Galloway's "The Trick Is to Keep Breathing". This was a BBC Radio 4 production in 1996 and also a Tron Theatre production the same year. Returning to London, Reader worked on new material with a backing band calling itself The Patron Saints of Imperfection (made up of Roy Dodds, Neill and Calum MacColl, and Phil Steriopoulos). This became her first solo album, recorded for RCA Records: 1992's "Mirmama". She met Geoff Travis who signed her to Warner Brothers subsidiary label, Blanco Y Negro, The managing director Rob Dickens executively produced her second solo album "Eddi Reader" (1994), which won her the "Best female singer" BRIT Award that year, followed by "Candyfloss and Medicine" (1996), and "Angels & Electricity" (1998). She parted from Warner Brothers and continued her work on Geoff Travis' Rough Trade label when she recorded "Simple Soul" (2001) and "Driftwood" (2002) – a "homegrown" release of songs recorded during the "Simple Soul" sessions. During this time, Reader also recorded the song "Ocean Love" for the soundtrack of the animated Danish film "Help! I'm a Fish" (2001). Reader also contributed vocals to one of Big Country's final singles before Stuart Adamson's death, "Fragile Thing." Reader continued to tour (England, Scotland, Japan, Australia, Spain, the United States, and Ireland). In 2003, she recorded her album of material by Robert Burns, with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, leading to good reviews and an international resurgence in interest in Scotland's "bard". In 2004, Reader sang at the re-opening of the new Scottish Parliament building, where she was presented to Queen Elizabeth II. She has described the experience: "I was honoured to sing at the opening of the parliament although I almost didn’t get to. I wanted to sing ‘Auld Lang Syne' as I thought that would have been perfect for the politicians with everyone shaking hands but they wanted me to sing it in 'F’ key and that wasn't the key for me so I told them I wasn't doing it. It was only at the last minute that I eventually agreed." She spent April 2006 touring Australia with Boo Hewerdine and Alan Kelly, following the release of "St Clare's Night Out: Live at The Basement", with Australian acts such as David Hosking invited to open the concerts. Reader's eighth studio album, "Peacetime", was released in 2007 on the Rough Trade record label. Produced by fellow Scottish folk musician, John McCusker, the album features a few Burns composed songs, alongside original material with long-time collaborator Boo Hewerdine and The Trash Can Sinatras' John Douglas. In spring 2008, Reader was a special guest at the Hotel Cafe Tour hosted by Tom McRae. In 2009, she performed in period-drama "Me and Orson Welles", directed by Richard Linklater and starring Zac Efron, Christian McKay and Claire Danes. Reader performed re-arranged 1930s standards, with Jools Holland, with whom she had previously collaborated on the single "Waiting Game". To commemorate the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns' birth, Reader released "The Songs of Robert Burns Deluxe Edition" in January 2009. The new release brought together the original Burns album with seven additional songs, two from the original 2003 sessions ("Green Grow the Rashes O", "Of A' the Airts"), three from 2007's "Peacetime" ("Ye banks and Braes", "Aye Waukin O" and "Leezie Lindsay") the unreleased "Dainty Davie", also from that session, and a brand new recording, "Comin' Thro the Rye/Dram Behind the Curtain". The new album was promoted, like the original release, with two sold-out shows at the annual Celtic Connections festival in Glasgow. In 2009 Reader released her ninth studio album, "Love is the Way", which was self-produced. In a special arrangement with record label Rough Trade she sold an exclusive, pre-released and minimally-packaged version of the disc on her 19-date autumn 2008 UK tour. In early 2010, Reader appeared on the Irish language album "Ceol '10 Súil Siar", singing an Irish language version of the Fairground Attraction song "Perfect" called "Foirfe". In December she released a live album on her own label and sold exclusively via her online store, "Live in Japan". Recorded from the sound desk at her Japan shows in September 2009, it was mastered and mixed by Mark Freegard who had worked on the 2009 album "Love is the Way". In 2013, Reader married John Douglas, a songwriter and member of The Trashcan Sinatras. Reader is writing a book for publication about her great-uncle Seamus (or James) Reader, who was head of the Scottish Brigade of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, when the Irish War of Independence broke out in 1919, later becoming a founder of the abortive Scottish Republican Army, which attempted to replicate the Irish struggle in Scotland between the wars. On Facebook, she posted that he: "was in command of 4,000 Scots involved in the Irish Rising build-up and the Irish war against The British state. In telling the story I felt my ancestor was passing the baton to me to tell the truthful story of this time" Reader has been a prominent advocate for the Yes Scotland movement, campaigning for a Yes vote in the referendum for Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. Her outspoken appearance on the British TV programme "Question Time" resulted in her being publicly criticised, with one viewer threatening on Twitter to cut her tongue out. Reader has said she is "an egalitarian who believes in the autonomy of small nations, it's unconscionable that those who call people 'nationalists' for wanting their country to manage its own wealth, do not recognise the 'nationalistic' choice of supporting a 'BRITISH nation'". Reader has claimed that, in reprisal for her advocacy for Scottish independence, Lord David Steel said, in a debate on Scottish independence in the House of Lords that Reader's work on Robert Burns was "murdering Burns' simple melodies". Reader also claims the newspaper The Scotsman, in reprisal for Reader choosing to advocate a yes vote, had published a story mischaracterising her political views and misrepresenting her great-uncle as a Nazi and leader in the Irish Republican Army, stating: "there’s people out there in Scotland, especially in the Press, and especially at The Scotsman — which is a very wrong name for that paper, because they don’t believe in Scotland at all; they believe in London management — who believe that Scots do not deserve the vote. I don’t want to be in that team." She has issued a formal appeal to the Press Complaints Commission, alleging that: "The article was trying to portray ALL people wanting to have Scots running Scotland and independence voters as having links with the early Fascists. The journalist scrapped around and tried to attach my great-uncle, who supported independence, to a 'Nazi' group and a terrorist organisation, creating hateful responses and threats to my family." The Robert Burns project saw Reader awarded an MBE for outstanding contributions to the arts in the New Year's honours list of 2006. In May 2007, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Strathclyde. Later that year she was recognised for her contributions to music and to the education and encouragement of young musicians with an honorary doctorate and a Doctor of Letters from Glasgow Caledonian University. In June 2008 she received another doctorate for her musical work, this time from the University of Stirling, and in 2013 she received an honorary doctor of music award from the University of Edinburgh. !

He was a member of James Cook's second voyage to the Pacific Ocean, and is best known for the sketches and paintings of locations he visited on that voyage, including Table Bay, Tahiti, Easter Island, New Zealand, Dusky Sound and the Antarctic. Hodges was born on 28 October 1744 in London. He studied under William Shipley, and afterwards in the studio of Richard Wilson, where he met Thomas Jones. During his early career, he made a living by painting theatrical scenery. Between 1772 and 1775 Hodges accompanied James Cook to the Pacific as the expedition's artist. Many of his sketches and wash paintings were adapted as engravings in the original published edition of Cook's journals from the voyage. Most of the large-scale landscape oil paintings from his Pacific travels for which Hodges is best known were finished after his return to London; he received a salary from the Admiralty for the purposes of completing them. These paintings depicted a stronger light and shadow than had been usual in European landscape tradition. Contemporary art critics complained that his use of light and colour contrasts gave his paintings a rough and unfinished appearance. Hodges also produced many valuable portrait sketches of Pacific islanders and scenes from the voyage involving members of the expedition. In 1778, under the patronage of Warren Hastings, Hodges travelled to India, one of the first British professional landscape painters to visit that country. He remained there for six years, staying in Lucknow with Claude Martin in 1783. His painting of "Futtypoor Sicri" is in Sir John Soane's Museum. Later Hodges travelled across Europe, including a visit to St. Petersburg in Russia in 1790. In 1793 Hodges published an illustrated book about his travels in India. In December 1794 Hodges opened an exhibition of twenty-five of his own works at Orme's Gallery, 14 Old Bond Street, London that included two large paintings called "The Effects of Peace" and "The Effects of War". In late January, 1795, with Britain engaged in the War of the First Coalition against Revolutionary France and feelings running high, the exhibition was visited by Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, the second son of King George III. The Duke took offence at the political nature of Hodges' paintings and ordered the exhibition closed; this royal censure effectively ended Hodges' career as a painter. Many of his works were then sold by auction but produced only an inconsiderable sum. Hodges retired to Devon and became involved with a bank, which failed during the banking crisis of March, 1797. On 6 March of that year, he died from what was officially recorded as "gout in the stomach", but which was also rumoured to be suicide from an overdose of laudanum. Hodges Knoll in Antarctica is named after William Hodges. On 11 May, 1776, Hodges married Martha Bowden Nesbit, the daughter of William and Jane Nesbit, at St George’s, Hanover Square, London. The couple settled in Pimlico. They undertook a tour of Wales and the Midlands, during which they visited Derby, where Joseph Wright painted a portrait of Martha Hodges. Sadly, Martha died within a year, possibly during childbirth. Having finished his work for the Admiralty, and with the death of his wife, Hodges was free to travel. Hodges left India in November 1783, in Worcester. This ship was nearly wrecked at St. Helena, but reached Britain in June 1784. Hodges is reputed to have returned a rich man, and settled in Queen Street, Mayfair, where he built himself a studio. He brought home with him a son, James. Hodges’ mother looked after her new grandson in a house in Tunbridge Wells, which Hodges purchased. William Hodges began preparing a collection, Select Views in India in the Years 1780–1783, that included a series of forty-eight aquatints adapted from sketches drawn in India. On 16 October, 1784, again at St George’s, Hanover Square, Hodges married his second wife, Lydia Wright. Lydia was the niece of John Whitehurst from Derby. Unfortunately, she too died after only a few months of marriage, possibly from alcoholism. n December 1785, Hodges married for a third time. It was to Ann Mary Carr, a talented pianist, and the oldest of the five children of Benjamin and Elizabeth Carr. Her parents were already deceased when she married Hodges. At about the same time, Hodges was listed as the guardian of Ann Mary’s brother, John, later a famous travel writer. They would have two daughters and three sons together. Hodges was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1789, and continued to exhibit there until 1794. After experiencing financial diffi-culties, he made an unsuccessful trip to seek patronage in Russia in 1792. On his return, in February, 1793, Hodges published his account of his time in India, entitled Travels in India in the Years 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783, illustrated with plates derived from his drawings. In December 1794, Hodges held a private exhibition of 25 of his pictures in old Bond Street, London. Remarkably, it received no subscription, and made no sales, forcing Hodges to close it by 26 January, 1795. Totally disillusioned, Hodges retired from his profession, sold his London property, and moved himself and his family, in July, 1795, to Brixham and Dartmouth in South Devon. There, he attempted to restore his fortunes by becoming a partner in a small bank at Dartmouth. His partner was Thomas Gretton, a lawyer. Also present in South Devon was Gretton’s brother, the Reverend George Gretton. The Grettons were the nephews of John and Elizabeth Whitehurst of Derby, further evidence of the family connections with the town.The bank opened in Dartmouth on the 24th August, 1795, and the following is an extract from the Exeter Flying Post dated the 1st October, 1795: "The public are hereby informed that on this day Bank was opened at Dartmouth in the county of Devon under the firm of J. Seale, Hodges, Gretton and Ful where business will be transacted with the greatest punctuality. Dartmouth, 24th August, 1795." Banknotes, dated 24 August, 1795, exist, issued by Hodges and Thomas Gretton & Co., payable on demand in Dartmouth or at their London agents, Walwyn, Petrie, Ward and McGregor. The bank would soon be known as the Dartmouth Bank and incorporated the Arms of Dartmouth on a shield on its notes. In October, 1795, new partners were added, probably to inject new capital into the bank. They were John Seale, a local landowner, and William Tult. John Seale was a very influential person in Dartmouth at the time, holding extensive property and land both in and around Dartmouth. Thomas Gretton was a practising attorney in the town. Not unlike many other banks of the period, there appear to have been problems from quite soon after the bank's inception. The ongoing war with France had severe effects on Dartmouth, and this, together with a stoppage of payments at the Bank of England, caused a run on the bank in March 1797. The Exeter Flying Post of the 13th September, 1798, has an official notice relating to Thomas Gretton's personal bankruptcy. John Seale, however, appears to have come out of this affair with his reputation unscathed as both he and his descendants remained very influential in the area throughout the 19th century. Hodges died at 10.00 a.m. on Monday, 6th March, 1797. The cause of death, as rumour would have it locally, was through an overdose of laudanum, which Hodges used as medication to treat his stomach gout. Whether the overdose was accidental or deliberate we shall probably never know for certain. However, we do know that he was under severe stress at the time caused by his own parlous financial situation and the impending collapse of the bank, both of which appeared intertwined. The Burial Register of St. Mary's Church, Brixham records William Hodges, burial 13th March, 1797. No headstone has been found. In spite of his financial problems, he nevertheless appeared to be liked and well respected, both locally and farther afield. As a young man, both Cook and Wales enjoyed his company during the three years that he spent on the Resolution on Cook's second epic voyage, and Cook greatly admired the young painter's sea and landscapes of the voyage. The "Gentleman's Magazine" reported of his death in 1797 as follows: "Of the gout in his stomach, William Hodges Esq. R. A. of Brixham, Devon; a man of varied and considerable knowledge in his art. If he did not rise to the summit of landscape painting, there were in general strength, correctness, and taste in his productions. His paintings and drawings of Asiatic scenery are deservedly admired. With a modesty that always characterizes worth and genius, he retired from the prosecution of his art, conceiving that his place would be filled by men of greater merit. He had, therefore, with the profit of his labours in the East, taken a share in a provincial bank, which, with his attention, his integrity, and the many friends his virtues and talents had procured him, would probably have proved a prosperous undertaking. His personal manners were easy, affable and communicative; and all he said was marked by good sense, truth and simplicity. He has left to regret his loss a numerous train of friends and a widow, who is one of the most amicable and accomplished women in the kingdom, though the delicacy of her mind has chiefly confined the reputation of her merit and abilities within the sphere of domestic intercourse and enjoyment." Hodges left his wife and children in great want. However, many of his friends soon rallied around to try and ease their burden, and for this, and other information relating to events soon after his death, we have the "Farrington Diaries", written daily as events unfolded. Joseph Farrington R.A. (1747 -1821) studied as a pupil under Richard Wilson R.A. at the same time as Hodges and later both became fellow Royal Academicians. They appear to have remained life long friends. An entry relating to the disposal of some of Hodges' personal possessions was written some years later on the 3rd October, 1809, when Farrington was journeying through the West Country and visited Brixham: "_____ told us that after his death there was a sale at his house and that many articles, particularly valuable books, were sold for almost nothing. But that she understood that the most valuable part of his drafts (drawings) as she called them were reserved by Mr. Carr (Sir John), and that though some were sold they were those of the least value." Sir John Carr, 1772 - 1832, was a native of Totnes (approximately eight miles from Brixham ) who for health reasons frequently travelled abroad and wrote books on his travels. As Hodges was employed by the Admiralty on Cook's second voyage and all paintings and drawings of the voyage belonged to them. However, he also repeated some of them. </doc> <doc id="2343565" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343565" title="Aubrey Beauclerk, 6th Duke of St Albans"> Aubrey Beauclerk, 6th Duke of St Albans Aubrey Beauclerk, 6th Duke of St Albans (21 August 1765 – 12 August 1815) was the son of Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans by his wife Catherine.

She was the second Finngrundet lightvessel, built in Gävle, Sweden in 1903 and replacing one dating from 1859. She was stationed on the Finngrund banks in the Baltic Sea northeast of Gävle during the ice-free part of the year. She was extensively modified in a refit in 1927 at Öregrunds Ship och Varvs AB, the original paraffin light being replaced with an AGA beacon. The fog bell was augmented with a "nautophone" fog signal and an underwater fog signal. Further modifications in 1940 work included the addition of wireless communication along with equipment for her to function as a weather station, and the electrification of her light. Her final refit was in 1957 when the deckhouse and crew space were modified. The optics were built by G.W. Lyth of Stockholm. They are mounted 11.5 metres above sea level and had a range of around . Two flashes were produced every 20 seconds (1 second on, 3.5 seconds off, 1 second on and 14.5 seconds off).

Candelaria is one of the municipalities of the Lempira department. It is located 96 km away from Gracias city, and passing by San Juan del Caite (Intibuca). In terms of time, that is about 3.5 hours of driving on an unpaved road, going up and down through mountains, one of them is "Congolón" where the hero Lempira fought the Spanish conquerors. This road is constantly being repaired all year long by "Fondo Cafetero" and the Government. One must pay attention to all deviations, hopefully there are several houses to ask for direction in any case. Its origins go back to 3 August 1607, with the name of "San Francisco de Joconguera" and under statement No 5. It became a village in 1872 and on 20 February 1897 it was given the title of municipality under the administration of president Policarpo Bonilla as "Candelaria de Joconguera". It became a city on 22 February 1939, after Antiguo de la Rañírez led a revolution to liberate the Candelarian people. When arriving at Candelaria the Pine forests are no longer around, this makes the weather warmer, caused by the change in elevation above sea level. It was settled in a despression surrounded by steep hills, some of them even craggy. There are some small streams which are helpful for water supply. Its boundaries are: The elevation and soil do not allow for coffee plantations, but the processes of peeling, drying and toasting of coffee grains are done. Corn and bean crops are very important. Commerce activities are very popular since the main road leads to the border with El Salvador, and the US dollar can be used as currency as well. The centre of the city and the nearest villages have electricity. The water supply is obtained from wells and some streams. There is one local organisation and its function is to improve the production of local products. The typical cross-breed of native Indians and Spanish settlers is seen in Candelaria, but also are seen individuals with features of each race separately. The City of Candelaria is very quaint and may result in a nice place to visit, due to the colonial details of its houses and buildings. There are 2 hostels with good facilities. Also the visitor can find 3 places with internet access, one of them in the Mayor's office. There is coverage for mobile phones. There many groceries and supplies stores that can make life easier. </doc> <doc id="2343578" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343578" title="Cololaca"> Cololaca Cololaca is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. Cololaca is one of the municipalities of the Lempira department. It is located more than 200 km away from Gracias. There is also an alternate way to go there, and that is taking a deviation in San Marcos de Ocotepeque. Taking this unpaved road takes about 30 minutes to Cololaca. The Government is currently working on paving the road from San Marcos de Ocotepeque to Cololaca. It started in a private property, that belonged to an old community, back in 1628. According to tales of elderly inhabitants, it became legal as a municipality in 1835, from Guarita district. The forests around Cololaca are Dry Sub Tropical forest, because they reflect the lack of water, but during the rainy season everything becomes green. It has very high and steep hills. And also many places ideal for cattle. Its boundaries are: The elevation and soil do not allow coffee plantations, but the processes of peeling, drying and toasting of coffee grains are done. Corn and bean crops are very important. But also vegetable are sown for local distribution. Cattle, milk and milk products are common in Cololaca. Since it is near San Marcos de Ocotepeque, the commerce activities are very fluid, and is the main provider for Cololaca. The typical cross-breed of native Indians and Spanish settlers is seen in Cololaca. Cololaca has the typical distribution of colonial architecture.

Erandique is one of the several municipalities of the Lempira department. One has to travel on road CA11A from the city of Gracias passing by San Juan (del Caite). A second road (V-787) that leads to Erandique is going by the town of "Dolores" in Intibuca. Also this roads leads to the municipality of San Francisco. The main disadvantage of this second road is that is not repaired often. If one enters from San Juan, Erandique has one exit to San Francisco and the other to the rest of the municipalities such as San Andrés and so on. The town is served by Erandique (Gualguire) Airport, a grass airstrip east of town. Erandique was founded in 1600 under the name of "Cerquin", due to its location on the west of the Cerquin hill. It was registered in 1733 in the volume II of the Real State book, dated on 28 November. According to tales from elderly citizens, the original act was lost and it was replaced on 14 February 1882, in the administration of Dr Marco Aurelio Soto. Erandique is one of the oldest municipalities and it became a city on 3 March 1932. Erandique is still surrounded by pine forests, with some pockets of Sweetgum (Liquidamber) trees. The terrain is rugged, characterised by steep hills. The weather is cool during the rainy season (May–October), and warmer in the dry season. The predominant soil is derived from volcanic rocks. During the rainy season, this soil that forms from the degradation of the rocks becomes extremely slippery, and it is common for unpaved roads to wash away and for routes to become impassable. Many of the pine forests are still used as a source of biofuel for the local population. Its boundaries are: The coffee plantations have great importance to Erandique, but they are located in the villages and mountains at higher elevations around the city centre, such as "Cerquin" hill. Therefore, it is a gathering point of coffee and it also processes the grains. Following coffee, there is also agricultural production of corn and beans, as well as some vegetable crops and small herds of cattle. Currently there is electricity and telecommunications services from the national company and mobile phone services. It is very important to tell that a small hospital works in Erandique. It has an ambulance service and the serious cases are taken to Gracias. It is worth mentioning that a group of US volunteers runs a small clinic to help the poorest citizens. Daily bus service available to both Gracias and La Esperanza once per day. There is one gas station and several places to fix flat tires. Half of the population in Erandique are descended from native Indians. The other half of the population is mestizo (mixed-race ). During the holidays and other activities is when the direct descendants are seen; they still prefer to live isolated. The landscapes in Erandique are considered beautiful around the country due to the pine and swetgum (Liquidamber) forests.The people from Erandique are nice and welcoming. There are a couple of places for internet access. There are also several places to enjoy the typical food and only one that offers more variety of dishes, such as shrimps and seafood soup, since some come from the coastal city of La Ceiba. Downtown the visitor can see many old adobe houses. Some streets are paved with rocks and there are 2 very old churches to visit. </doc> <doc id="2343584" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343584" title="Gualcince"> Gualcince Gualcince () is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira.

The inhabitants of Gracias, La Campa, and other nearby aldeas, including San Manuel Colohete, are mainly of Lenca descent. Although the aldea is small, there are multiple smaller and spread out satellite communities in the hills above La Campa, such as Cruz Alta. These communities grow coffee to consume and sell; substance crops of rice, mango, a dozen varieties of bananas, and black beans; and run their own public elementary schools and churches. The town is known as a centre of Lenca pottery production, of which there are two main styles; there are black and white (smoked) pots and red-glazed pots. La Campa's are of the latter style. Much of the pottery sold in La Campa is brought down from the hillside villages, where the villagers are adept pottery makers. The town also has a large 18th-century Spanish church. La Campa sits in a deep river valley near Montaña Celaque ( Cerro Las Minas), the tallest mountain in Honduras. La Campa in 1582 was a small town with 20 tributaries to encomendero Mario Cana. It was previously known as "Tecauxinas", back in 1887 it was a village of Gracias. It became a municipality in 1921. The name of "La Campa" has its origins in an expression used by old miners, it had to do with searching protection against the rain.

La Iguala is one of the oldest municipalities of the Lempira department. The municipality capital is also known as "La Iguala Centro". The access to this town is quite a challenge. Both ways will be briefly described here. The first one is to take the road to the other municipalities of San Rafael and La Unión, going up and down mountains for 30 km and through several communities. At "El Matazano" community is the detour for "La Iguala Centro" after 15 km. This second part of the journey from "El Matazano" is rough due to the conditions of the road. The alternate way takes 30 minutes but it is only recommended for 4 wheel drive vehicles, on the road the Belén at 12 km is located the deviations at "Los Siles" community. La Iguala is an ancient town founded by the Lenca Indians. Its first municipality goes back to May 1, 1556, with the name of "Santiago de La Iguala", over time shortened to "La Iguala".

It has electricity and mobile communications services. When going to "La Iguala Centro", one can see the traits of the people. 3/4 of them are descendants from Lencas natives, the remaining 1/4 are Mestizos. This municipality does not have much to offer. Suggested attractions are the old colonial church and some birth certificate from 1883 in the local office. La Iguala offers visitors the stillness of a rural area and fishing. </doc> <doc id="2343590" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343590" title="Las Flores, Lempira"> Las Flores, Lempira Las Flores is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. Las Flores is one of the municipalities of the Lempira department. It is located from Gracias on the paved road that leads to Santa Rosa de Copán. The town is away from the paved road. The very first settlers were from La Paz department. It was first called "Las Flores de Santa Bárbara", honoring the image of the saint of that place. It was granted the category of municipality on 1 January 1869. This municipality is in a valley, near to a river. The vegetation corresponds to dry sub-tropical forests. The weather is hot since it is in a valley. There are some hills around it but they are not so high or steep. Its boundaries are: The most important economical activity is commerce due to its location near to Gracias city and Santa Rosa de Copán city. On both sides of the road are several restaurants, stores, and car workshops. Cattle and Milk products are for local consumption. Another popular activity is to collect gravel, sand and construction materials from the two nearby rivers. Most of this material is required by Gracias city. Recently, the material has been used in the highway extension between Gracias, Lempira, and La Esperanza, Intibucá. Most of the people that live in the town only make their school in there. After that most of the people move to the nearest city, Santa Rosa de Copan, where education is more efficient. Because of the peace that the inhabitants experience it is very normal for them to gather at the central park or on streets very late at night. In this case 90% of the people are cross-breed of native Indians and Spanish settlers. A 1 hour visit to the downtown of Las Flores will do to get to know it.

It is one of the smallest municipalities of the Lempira department; travel to La Unión is a challenge. One way is to go 75 km from Gracias city on the common road for La Iguala and San Rafael, about 3 km before San Rafael is a left turn. An additional 13 km must be travelled. Another way is via Santa Bárbara-El Nispero-San Jerónimo-San Rafael-La Unión; the first 3 locations are in Santa Bárbara department.

The length of the range is 150 km and the highest point is Mount Mepistskharo at an elevation of 2,850 m above sea level. The Meskheti Range is characterized by high amounts of precipitation. The territory around Mt. Mtirala (the Ajarian section of the range) was the wettest region within the Soviet Union and is the most humid area of the Caucasus with an annual precipitation of approximately 4500mm/year. The slopes of the Meskheti Range are mainly covered by deciduous forests (oak, chestnut, maple, hornbeam, beech) below 1,200 m above sea level and by coniferous forests (spruce, fir and in some cases pine) from 1,200-1,800 m. The highest regions of the range are covered by sub-alpine and alpine meadows. Strabo mentions the Moschian Mountains as joining the Caucasus.

It is hard to get there and the traveller can take any road, however, the suggested option is via Santa Rosa de Copán-San Marcos de Ocotepeque-Cololaca-Valladolid-La Virtud-Mapulaca. On the other hand, if the traveller is coming from La Esperanza, Intibuca obviously the road to take is via Santa Cruz-San Andrés-Candelaria-Either way it takes about 5 or 6 hours to get there. There is a well known point on the border, "El Puente Colgante" (The Hanging Bridge), which leads to Sonsonate municipality in El Salvador. Also, there is a new bridge called "Puente La Intregracion". Mapulaca was founded on 30 October 1692. In the census of 1791, it was part of "Curato de Cerquin".

Its boundaries are: The main economic activity is commerce, and especially since the border is only 3 km away from the departmental capital. The next activity is corn and beans crops and on, a smaller scale, is cattle and milk products, these last are mostly for local consumption. It has had electricity for 4 years now and also mobile communication services. The water is obtained from wells, but it is not enough for the local demand. It has 2 hardware stores and several grocery stores. In some houses, people sell gasoline or diesel fuels. The majority of the population is Mestizo. Due to its geography and location, Mapulaca is only a place to pass by. The "Puente Colgante" is the place of the border to go to El Salvador. It is necessary to cross the hanging bridge to make it to Chalatenango municipality in El Salvador. This bridge is an adventure itself, it was built by a Swiss man also known as "Toni El Suizo", who built more hanging bridges after hurricane Mitch back in 1998. The Lempa River is a good place for swimming, but its currents are very strong and dangerous, so extreme care is advised. There are several tributaries to the Lempa, which are also nice places to cool off. There is only one hostel in Mapulaca with only one "restaurant", which is quite small. </doc> <doc id="2343600" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343600" title="Piraera"> Piraera Piraera is one of the municipalities of Lempira department in Honduras. It is located on one of the branches of "Congolón" mountain, it is 105 km away from the city of Gracias. Its first inhabitants came from San Antonio, Santa Lucia and Magdalena in Intibuca department. In the population record of 1702 there were some people booked. In the census of 1791, it is a town part of "Curato" de Cerquin and in 1889 it was a municipality of Candelaria. It is supposed that "Lempira", the national hero, received the power from "Etempic" chief when the Spanish arrived, lived in this municipality. Since it is located on the mountains, the main forests are Pines and Oaks. Its elevation above sea level is the proper one for coffee plantations. Its mountains and hills are very high and steep. It has several water springs running down the steep hills. One curiosity is a huge rock monolith on the way to the departmental capital, which proves the volcanic origins of the rocks in this municipality and the rest of the department. Its boundaries are: Coffee is the main product up in Piraera, followed by cattle, milk derivates, corn, beans, and commerce. The trees are plenty and yield some income. It also has several water springs, for people and cattle and for the crops. As the rest of the department it has electricity, Internet access in the Mayor's and with mobile communication services. A few people sell fuels in their houses. The majority of the population is Mestizo. The traveler must go through Santa Cruz, San Andrés and Gualcince municipalities. The deviation to Piraera is from Gracias, to the left, or at any time the locals can help to find the correct way. This dirt road is repaired constantly along the year. The visitor must be careful during the rainy season due to landslides along the way. It has little to offer to visitors, it has the typical colonial distribution. Perhaps the most interesting activity is to hike some hills, which have amazing views of the volcanos of El Salvador, Intibuca department etc. Also, there is an exotic waterfall on the way, good for cooling off after the long trip. </doc> <doc id="2343601" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343601" title="San Andrés, Lempira"> San Andrés, Lempira San Andrés is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. It is notable as the principal site in Honduras for the mining of andesite opals from Las Colinas deposit near Sosoal, which is in the municipality. This mining is largely performed by artisanal miners, rather than on an industrial scale. It is approximately 120 km from Gracias city. It is about 1 hour away from Erandique city. In the census of 1801 it was known as "Guaxinlaca" village, under the delegation of "Gracias a Dios". In the national division of 1889, it appeared as a municipality of Erandique district. Since it is located on the mountains, the main forests are Pines and Oaks. Its elevation above sea level is the proper one for coffee plantations. Its mountains and hills are very high and steep. It has several water spring running down the steep hills. One curiosity is a huge rock monolith on the way to the departmental capital, which proves the volcanic origins of the rocks in this municipality and the rest of the department. Its boundaries are: The main product of this municipality is coffee, taking advantage of its elevation from sea level and soil conditions. Vegetables, Corn and Beans are second in importance, and then follows cattle raising and milk products. These last items are mostly for local consumption. The exploitation of the forest is rational yet. There is electricity, but they sometimes have problems with it, and the absence can last up to 3 days. There is also coverage of mobiles services. And in some houses, people sell gasoline and diesel fuel. In the particular case of this municipality, the descendants of Indians take the highest percent, mostly in the surrounding villages. The cross-breed of Spanish and Indians takes the rest. The deviation to San Andrés is better known as "El Guayabo"; from there, is 15 minutes left to the main town. In some sections the road narrows down to 1 lane and others it turns very slippery, so caution is advised. The best attraction it has are the forests, especially "Liquidambar" forest, because when they change their leaves depending on the season, the landscapes are just gorgeous. The coffee "Fincas" also provide amazing views. There are no hostels, or any places to stay, but since it close to Erandique, that can be solved. It doesn't have a formal place to eat either, but there's an old lady, about half a block away from the Mayor's office, who cooks delicious typical meals. On the holidays, many people attend and some bring their products. </doc> <doc id="2343602" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343602" title="San Francisco, Lempira"> San Francisco, Lempira San Francisco is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira. It is one of the furthest municipalities of the Lempira department in Honduras. The lands for this municipality were given away by the King of Spain, on 30 October 1692, composed of 2 titles, "Santa Maria Magdalena" and "San Lucas". In the census of 1791 it appears as part of "Curato de Cerquin". It was founded back in 1837 for the initiative of Captain Jeronimo Acosta. The church was built in 1856, a historical relic left by the Spanish colonist. But as it can be seen in the photo in this article, the date on the "facade" of the church is 1737. Something worth verifying. In the national division of 1896, it was one of the municipalities of Erandique district. The municipality capital is located at the toe of "Gelpoa" hill. To get to this capital it is necessary to go up and down mountains and hills, mostly going down, while doing this, the elevation from sea level decreases, this is why the vegetation is typical of dry sub tropical forests. The weather is warm most of the year. In some uninhabited places, there are pine forests. Its boundaries are: The main products of this municipality are corn and beans. There are very few areas suitable for coffee plantations. The water for human consumption is obtained for excavated wells and some small streams nearby. Cattle and milk products are for local consumption. As does the rest of the department, it has electricity, mobile communication services and internet access at the mayor's office. Groceries stores are quite plentiful. In some houses, people sell gasoline and diesel fuel. It is very common to see people who are descendants of the Indians, followed by a few individuals of cross-breed of Spanish and Indians. Both ways to get there require a great deal of endurance and patience. If the visitor is in Gracias, then he must go to San Juan del Caite, Intibuca for the junction of the road the "San Miguelito, Intibuca" or Erandique. If the visitor is in "La Esperanza, Intibuca", then they must go to "San Miguelito" and after that to "Dolores,Intibuca". There is another junction of the road from Erandique and Dolores, Intibuca in a community called "San Antonio". This road is in bad shape half of the year, so caution is advised. It has little to offer to the visitors. Perhaps the antique church is the best attraction. But that is not a problem at all; because there is a DVD store, where the visitor can find the newest Hollywood premieres, on the other hand, the nearest place to fix a flat tire is 30 km away in Erandique. The people are very welcoming and kind to the foreigners. </doc> <doc id="2343604" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343604" title="Moritz Carrière"> Moritz Carrière Moritz Carrière (5 March 1817 – 19 January 1895) was a German philosopher and historian. Carrière was born in Griedel near Darmstadt, Germany. After studying at Giessen, Göttingen and Berlin, he spent a few years in Italy studying the fine arts, and established himself in 1842 at Giessen as a teacher of philosophy. In 1853 he was appointed professor at the University of Münich, where he lectured mainly on aesthetics. In the academy in Munich, he lectured on art history. Carrière contributed in no small degree to making the idea of German unity more palatable to the South Germans. Carrière identified himself with the school of the younger Fichte as one who held the theistic view of the world which aimed at reconciling deism with pantheism, and Christianity with science, art, and history, and who were opposed to ultramontanism. He urged the conversion of the cathedral of Cologne into a free church. Although no obstinate adherent of antiquated forms and prejudices, he firmly upheld the fundamental truths of Christianity. Carrière died in Munich on 19 January 1895. He translated the letters of Abélard and Héloise into German, and composed a poem on the last night of the Girondists. His essay on Cromwell (in "Lebensskizzen", 1890) develops his liberal ideas and may be considered his political confession of faith. He has prepared annotated editions of Goethe's "Faust" and Schiller's "Wilhelm Tell". During the Franco-Prussian War, he delivered lectures on "Die sittliche Weltordnung in den Zeichen und Aufgaben unserer Zeit" (Munich, 1870), and on "Deutsche Geisteshelden im Elsass "(1871). His complete works were published at Leipzig, 14 vols., in 1886–1894. </doc> <doc id="2343605" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343605" title="San Juan Guarita"> San Juan Guarita San Juan Guarita is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira.

It was created with land that remained after its inhabitants sold the land to the "Ladinos" of Guarita. This caused problems to acquire the official land titles, and they decided to separate from Guarita. Between 1917 and 1919, the Amerindians tried to negotiate their land title, and this produced internal friction and disputes amongst Amerindians and Ladinos. Guarita became a city on February 26, 1934. Under the decree No 1187, the municipality of "San Juan Guarita".

It had to be respected by both municipalities and its adjudged rights forcing them to take the correcting measures by the Legislative Power. it was subscribed in both municipalities. But the differences continued among the towns. In 1935, the people were able to get a legitimate copy of the land titles and therefore the relationships among the inhabitants of both municipalities were improved.

In the case of San Rafael, the cross-breed take the 80% of the population, with many people showing white skin. The rest is occupied for Indian descendants. It takes about 2.5 hours to get there from the city of Santa Barbara and the road is in much better conditions. The other way is via the city of Gracias, and it is about 60 km from it. It is necessary to take the common road to La Iguala and La Unión, first passing by the "Puca" mountain and then some other steep mountains. The main disadvantage of this 2nd way is that the road needs to be repaired. The views of the coffee plantations are just awesome, and so are the rest of the landscapes provided by the big and steep mountains mentioned earlier in this article, this includes the views to Santa Bárbara department. The hospitality of its inhabitants is another feature, a proof of this is the sign that says: "En San Rafael, Nadie es Extraño", meaning: "In San Rafael, Nobody is a stranger". There are some groceries stores and one hostel, but it is not a recommendable place to stay in. </doc> <doc id="2343611" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343611" title="San Sebastian, Lempira"> San Sebastian, Lempira San Sebastian is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira.

As for the transportation services, only one bus is available and it stays in the municipality capital and travels back from Gracias in the afternoon. In this case, the descendants of Native Americans are only 60% of the population, the rest is made up of the cross-breed of Spanish and Indians, some of these individuals have white skin and blue or green eyes. Once Colohete is passed the road becomes narrower and steeper and therefore more dangerous. There is 1 river to cross, in the rainy season it is just not possible to do so. There is also a 2nd river, but in this case a bridge was built. The "congolon" mountain can be seen to the south and some other mountains in Ocotepeque to the north. The old church also gives a good reason to visit, if the traveller enjoys ancient colonial buildings. This municipality is in the "Colosuca" path, this is organised by the national institute of tourism and some Mayor's offices of several municipalities. The object of this is to show the Indian legacy. </doc> <doc id="2343613" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343613" title="Santa Cruz, Lempira"> Santa Cruz, Lempira Santa Cruz () is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira.

Also on the road there are a couple of quarries, they provide material for the maintenance of the road. Rocks of different colours and hardness' may be seen. It has a great amount of forestal resources, but all around the municipality capital less trees are seen, this is making the weather a little hotter than it used to be. Pine forests are the most prevalent but there is also a good amount of "Liquidambar" forest. These last change the colour of their leaves according to the season of the year. Its boundaries are: This is one of the poorest municipalities of the department. The coffee plantations are in the first place, nothing new. Cattle raising, corn and beans crops follow but are mostly for local use. It has electricity and mobile communication services and they obtained water from wells.

In Santa Cruz, the direct descendants of the indigenous peoples make up 85% of the population. The remainder are of mixed ancestry. The deviation for this municipality capital is not easy to see, it is approximately 20 km away from San Juan del Caite, right across a football field. From the deviation to the capital the road is not in the best conditions. There is not much to see in the municipality capital. Perhaps for people who like to visit old colonial buildings, its church is a forced stop. Without doubt, the best feature of this municipality is its Liquidambar forest because their leaves change colours, depending on the season of the year. Also it can be interesting to see the descendants of the Indians, since they still keep a lot of features of their ancestors. </doc> <doc id="2343614" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343614" title="Talgua"> Talgua Talgua () is a municipality in the Honduran department of Lempira.

It takes about 2.5 hours to travel there and it must be via Santa Rosa de Copán–San Marcos de Ocotepeque–Cololaca–Tambla–Valladolid. It was founded in the "Los Patios" village, with the former name of "Colopel", it was later relocated to "Los Naranjos" villages, where it is nowadays; and the name was changed to Valladolid. In the census of 1887 it was registered as a municipality of Guarita district. The origin of the rocks and soils in its mountains is totally volcanic. This is clearly seen on the slopes of the road. The municipality capital is on top of a mountain, and there are many pine forest and some sub tropical trees to provide shade to coffee plants. The weather is very cool because of the elevation and the Pine forests. Its boundaries are: It is one more of the municipalities proper for coffee plantation.

Virginia is located in Lempira Honduras and shares a border with El Salvador. Many Virginians travel to El Salvador to do their shopping, because the Honduran cities are far away from Virginia. It is one of the smallest municipalities of the Lempira department. It is 15 km or 30 minutes away from Mapulaca. And the best way to get there is via Gracias; observing all the warnings mentioned in previous articles. It was founded back in 1830. In the national division of 1889 it was one municipality of Candelaria. It is situated in a semi flat place and surrounded by many hills. The predominant vegetation corresponds to the sub tropical dry forest. In the municipality capital there are some inclined streets. Its boundaries are: Since it is on the border with El Salvador, it is much easier for people to go there to establish commercial activities. Also there are more and better jobs on the other side of the border, with the advantage of receiving their wages in US dollars. It is not an ideal location for coffee plantations, therefore corn and beans crops became important (even though they are for local consumption); followed by cattle raising. Like the rest of the department, it has electricity and mobile communication services. In Virginia, the cross-breed represents 80% of the population. The remaining portion is made up of the descendants of Lenca Indians, who live in the surrounding villages. As for the remaining 15 km, although this dirt road is not in the best condition, it is still an easy drive. A half-hour visit will be enough to see all there is to see in the municipality capital. For those who are interested in rural and quiet towns, this is a good place to visit. Surprisingly, the mobile phone signal from El Salvador is stronger than the Honduran signal. Since it is near the Lempa River, the local pastime is going there to bathe. The local holidays and festivals attract many visitors. </doc> <doc id="2343634" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343634" title="Lavinia Fontana"> Lavinia Fontana Lavinia Fontana (August 24, 1552 – August 11, 1614) was an Italian painter. She is regarded as the first woman artist, working within the same sphere as her male counterparts, outside a court or convent. She was the first woman artist to paint female nudes, and possibly the first female to use live nude female models. She was the main breadwinner of a family of 13. Lavinia Fontana was born in Bologna, the daughter of the painter Prospero Fontana, who was a prominent painter of the School of Bologna at the time and served as her teacher. Continuing the family business was typical at the time. Her earliest known work, "Monkey Child", was painted in 1575 at the age of 23. Though this work is now lost, another early painting, "Christ with the Symbols of the Passion", painted in 1576, is now in the El Paso Museum of Art. She would go on to paint in a variety of genres. Early in her career, she was most famous for painting upper-class residents of her native Bologna, notably noblewomen. Even as her gender may have hindered her career in a society less accustomed to female artists, it may have made women more comfortable sitting for her. Her relationships with female clients were often unusually warm; multiple women who sat for portraits painted by Fontana, such as the Duchess of Sora Constanza Sforza Boncompagni, later served as namesakes or godmothers for her children. She began her commercial practice by painting small devotional paintings on copper, which had popular appeal as papal and diplomatic gifts, given the value and lustre of the metal. In addition to portraits (the typical subject matter for women painters), she later created large scale paintings with religious and mythological themes which sometimes included female nudes. Fontana married Paolo Zappi (alternately spelled Paolo Fappi) in 1577. She gave birth to 11 children, though only 3 outlived her. After marriage, Fontana continued to paint to support her family. Zappi took care of the household and served as painting assistant to his wife, including painting minor elements of paintings like draperies. Fontana attended the University of Bologna, and completed a degree in 1580. Fontana and her family moved to Rome in 1603 at the invitation of Pope Clement VIII. She gained the patronage of the Buoncompagni, of which Pope Gregory XIII was a member. Lavinia thrived in Rome as she had in Bologna and Pope Paul V himself was among her sitters. She was the recipient of numerous honors, including a bronze portrait medallion cast in 1611 by sculptor and architect Felice Antonio Casoni. Some of her portraits, often lavishly paid for, have been wrongly attributed to Guido Reni. Chief among these are "Venus;" "The Virgin lifting a veil from the sleeping infant Christ"; and the "Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon". Her self-portrait – in youth she was said to have been very beautiful – was perhaps her masterpiece; it belongs to Count Zappi of Imola, the family into which Lavinia married. Fontana's self-portraiture strikes a balance between presenting the artist as a distinguished lady and as a professional artist. This depiction of two coexisting roles was common for sixteenth-century women artists. While her youthful style was much like her father's, she gradually adopted the Carracciesque style, with strong quasi-Venetian coloring. She was elected into the Accademia di San Luca of Rome, and died in that city on August 11, 1614. There are over 100 works that are documented, but only 32 signed and dated works are known today. There are 25 more that can be attributed to her, making hers the largest oeuvre for any female artist prior to 1700. Sofonisba Anguissola may have been an influence on her career. </doc> <doc id="2343635" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343635" title="Erythrolitmin"> Erythrolitmin Erythrolitmin (also called erythrolein) is the active ingredient extracted from the Litmus lichen, used in chemistry as a pH indicator. The erythrolitmin molecule is related to the orceins, and consists essentially of several phenoxazone and orcinol residues. The intense coloring of the molecule is generated by the absorption of specific wavelengths of light by the pi bonds. These bonds are ordinarily excited by light in the orange region of the spectrum, causing the molecule to appear blue. When the molecule interacts with protons from an acid the bonds become harder to excite and thus absorb green light which has a shorter wavelength. This is what causes the molecule to appear red in the presence of an acid. </doc> <doc id="2343641" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343641" title="List of universities in Afghanistan"> List of universities in Afghanistan The following is an incomplete list of universities in Afghanistan, sorted by province and in alphabetical order.

Its goals are to promote patriotism and to instill moral values into the youth of Belarus, using activities such as camping, sporting events and visiting memorials. The organization was created after a merger of other youth groups in 2002 and is the successor of the Leninist Communist Youth League of the Byelorussian SSR. The BRSM is the largest youth group in Belarus and is supported by the Belarusian government. Some people have accused the group of using methods of coercion and empty promises in order to recruit new members and of being used as propaganda for the government of Alexander Lukashenko. The BRSM was created on 6 September 2002, after the merger of two Belarusian youth organizations, the Belarusian Youth Union and the Belarusian Patriotic Youth Union. The Belarusian Youth Union had been considered the legal successor of Leninist Communist Youth Union of Belarus (the Komsomol branch in the Byelorussian SSR), and the Belarusian Patriotic Youth Union had been created in 1997 by the president of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko. Lukashenko not only issued a decree calling for the creation of the BRSM, he also issued decrees that gave the BRSM governmental support, mostly from the ministry of education and the presidential administration. President Lukashenko stated in his 2003 address to the nation the need for the BRSM to play a key role in Belarusian life: The BRSM national headquarters is located in Minsk, the national capital of Belarus. Each voblast of Belarus—Minsk, Brest, Vitsebsk, Homiel, Grodno and Mogilev—has its own branches of the BRSM. The BRSM has estimated that it has 6803 branches located inside Belarus. The national leadership of the BRSM is controlled by the central committee, which is headed by the first secretary of the central committee. Leonid Kovalev was elected as first secretary in 2006. Below the first secretary are the second secretary of the central committee, the chairman of the central investigation commission, and three secretaries of the central committee. Collectively, these leaders are also referred to as the secretariat of the BRSM. While the exact yearly and total funding of the BRSM are not known, the majority of funds given to the BRSM are given by the national government. The BRSM has two official symbols: an emblem and a flag. The emblem, which is based on the Komsomol badge and modeled on the Belarusian national flag, has a red bar bearing the initials of the BRSM, written in gold in Cyrillic, over a green bar bearing a golden olive branch. The flag of the BRSM has the same elements as the emblem, but the reverse of the flag bears the organization's full name in gold (in Russian) in the red section, with the green section unemblazoned. In order to join the BRSM, the applicant must be between the ages of 14 and 31 and must send a photo of himself or herself. If the applicant is between the ages of 14 and 16 written permission from a parent or legal guardian must be granted. A count in 2003 by the Institute for War and Peace Reporting showed that the BRSM had roughly . A person must also pay a one-time fee of 4000 Belarusian rubles (around US$0.22) and a mid-year fee to continue membership in the BRSM. The total amount of the fee is adjusted based on the person's working and living status, and fee waivers are granted for children who are orphaned or disabled. Most of the BRSM's activities are similar to those that were performed by the Soviet Komsomol. The main activities of the BRSM involve the promotion of Belarusian patriotism. This is accomplished by participating in wreath-laying ceremonies at various memorials around the country. BRSM members also pass out flowers to veterans of the Great Patriotic War (World War II) to honor their service during the national holiday Den Pobedy (Day of Victory). Both the memorial visits and the flowers for the veterans give BRSM members an idea of what sacrifices their ancestors made. During other national holidays, the BRSM passes out a ribbon that resembles the national flag of Belarus, to be worn on a shirt or jacket. This program, along with other events, is part of its "For Belarus!" (Belarusian: ) campaign. The BRSM participates in outdoor activities and sports, including football, running, swimming and hockey. Some of these athletic events involve different groups from inside Belarus or from neighboring countries, such as Russia, Ukraine or Latvia. BRSM members also participate in competitions amongst themselves or with other foreign groups that are similar to the BRSM. Social events, such as concerts for the youth of Belarus, are hosted by the BRSM. However, there have been some occasions during BRSM-sponsored concerts when neo-Nazis were not only in attendance but were also performing in the show. The BRSM has been criticized for this by local leaders and veterans. The BRSM was one of the main organizers of the 2004 "Miss Belarus" pageant, a beauty competition along the same lines as Miss America and Miss Universe. While the BRSM does not get involved in politics, its first secretary, Mikhail Orda, signed a letter along with other public officials denouncing the United States' Belarus Democracy Act of 2004. BRSM organizes student construction brigades, a practice also originated in the Soviet Union. Inside of Belarus, the BRSM has been accused of using unethical methods to increase its membership. The claim, made by teachers and students in Belarus, is that members who joined the BRSM either did so by coercion or were lured by promises, which included discounts at local businesses, living in good dormitories, and assistance in finding a job after college. In 1999 it was reported that Belarusian opposition activists called the predecessor of the BRSM, the BPSM, "Lukamol" (). The term is a combination of the words Lukashenko and Komsomol, because of the use of the youth group by Lukashenko to further his political base and his cult of personality. Human Rights Watch, a group that monitors human rights abuses around the world, has also criticized the BPSM for limiting academic freedom on Belarusian college campuses. HRW noted in a report filed in 1999 that HRW also noted in the same 1999 report that members influence the entrance board to exclude candidates who use the Belarusian language as their preferred language or those who have opposing political point of views. The United Nations has stated that Lukashenko's government has, either directly or indirectly, created non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are used by the government as tools of publicity. The UN contends in a report released in early 2003 that the BRSM will mostly be used by President Lukashenko as a tool to recruit officials into his government. The same report also commented on how other youth NGOs are having problems with funding and that their members face expulsion from their schools, thus having to join groups like the BRSM as a last resort. </doc> <doc id="2343661" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343661" title="Meier Tzelniker"> Meier Tzelniker Meier Tzelniker (1894–1982) was a British actor.

In 2005, it had over 700,000 electric customers in parts of three Nevada counties — a service area of more than . In 1998, Nevada Power merged with Nevada's other major utility, Sierra Pacific Resources. It continued as a subsidiary of Sierra Pacific until 2005, when the company changed its name to NV Energy. Nevada Power was founded on March 20, 1906 as Consolidated Power and Telephone, the electric and telephone company for the year-old town of Las Vegas. It split into two companies in 1929. The telephone company, Southern Nevada Telephone Company, eventually was acquired by Centel. It was later owned by Sprint and Embarq, and is now part of CenturyLink. The power company became Southern Nevada Power. In 1937, it became the first utility to receive power from the Hoover Dam. As the Las Vegas Valley boomed in the 1950s, its power needs exceeded the power available from the dam, and Southern Nevada Power began building its own steam turbines. After buying the Elko-Lamoille Power Company, it was renamed Nevada Power in 1961. A year later, it became the first Nevada company on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1999, the company merged with Sierra Pacific Resources of Reno, the main electric and natural gas provider for northern Nevada. The merged company retained the Sierra Pacific name, but moved its headquarters to Las Vegas. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Nevada Power held off on building new plants and was looking to divest its existing plants based on Nevada's deregulation of power generation and distribution. However, after the energy crisis in 2001, the deregulation was put on hold and Nevada Power resumed pursuing options to generate more of its own power. In 2003 the company installed two of the largest phase shifting transformers in the world at its Crystal switching station to deal with the large quantity of imported power. As a part of the plan to internally generate more of its power, Nevada Power in October, 2004 purchased from Duke Energy North America a partially competed 1,200 megawatt plant. Plans were announced on June 21, 2005 to purchase from Pinnacle West Capital Corporation its 75% interest in a 570 megawatt plant. The other 25% share is owned by the Southern Nevada Water Authority. In January 2006, Nevada Power announced plans to decommission units 1, 2, and 3 at the Clark Station which provide a total of 175 MW of power. On September 22, 2008, Nevada Power Company began doing business as NV Energy. This is the result of the corporate decision to unify its image under a single brand. In 2013 Berkshire Hathaway's MidAmerican Energy (now Berkshire Hathaway Energy) announced it would purchase NV Energy. MidAmerican and NV Energy say both companies' boards have approved the sale and they expect it to close in the first quarter of 2014, subject to approval by regulators and NV Energy shareholders. The move will expand MidAmerican's customer base by over one million to 8.4 million worldwide and boost its assets to $66 billion. In the early years, power was generated by the company. However, in 1914 the company contracted to purchase power from other companies. This practice continued until the 1950s when the company again started running power plants to provide a portion of its base supply. Several generating stations are located in Nevada Power's service area. In addition, Nevada power historically imported a large portion of its power from other areas. As a result, the company's main transmission lines both serve its customers and provide inter-company power transport services. Nevada Power is a member of the regional transmission organization RTO West, formally known as "Grid West" . </doc> <doc id="2343670" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343670" title="Peter Mauzey"> Peter Mauzey Peter Mauzey is an electrical engineer associated with the development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s at the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center. He served as an adjunct professor at Columbia University while employed as an engineer at Bell Labs (later Lucent Technologies) in New Jersey. Mauzey began working with electronic music pioneer Vladimir Ussachevsky while still a student at Columbia in 1951. He worked at the university radio station WKCR, and introduced Ussachevsky to the use of magnetic tape feedback as a source and modifier of sound effects which could be incorporated into music. He helped build the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer and became the first director of engineering at the new center in 1959. According to Thom Holmes' "Electronic and experimental music: technology, music, and culture" he was "the lead engineer of the center". Mauzey and his staff developed a large variety of customized equipment designed to solve the needs of the composers working at the center. These include early prototypes of tape delay machines, quadraphonic mixing consoles, and analog triggers designed to facilitate interoperability between other (often custom-made) synthesizer equipment. Robert Moog, who developed the music synthesizer into a practical instrument, learned his trade from Mauzey as a Columbia student in the early 1960s. </doc> <doc id="2343676" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343676" title="John Gale"> John Gale John Gale may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2343678" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343678" title="2003 IBF World Championships"> 2003 IBF World Championships The 13th IBF World Championships were held in the National Indoor Arena, Birmingham, United Kingdom, between 28 July and 3 August 2003.

It was the second book ever published documenting the making of this film, released a year after Doug McClelland's 1976 work "Down the Yellow Brick Road". The book was published in November 1977, after the film had been telecast a total of nineteen times. With 93 photos, the book tells readers how the film was made and describes the Golden Era of moviemaking in the 1930s and 1940s at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The book took two years to be created. Aljean Harmetz researched the film and the studio and interviewed the surviving cast, crew and MGM staff. From the acquisition of the music to the scripts, casting, and filming, Harmetz's book provides readers with a detailed re-creation of how the studio produced this film. It was reissued in paperback in 1984, and again with a new preface by the author for the film's 50th anniversary in 1989. Another reissue was released, again with a new preface, shortly before the film's theatrical re-release in 1998, and another reissue is planned for the film's 75th anniversary in 2013. After the success of the book, Aljean Harmetz adapted her knowledge and contacts with the film's survivors into a 30-minute PBS documentary in 1979. </doc> <doc id="2343686" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343686" title="Friedrich Mandl"> Friedrich Mandl Friedrich ('Fritz') Mandl (9 February 1900 – 8 September 1977) was chairman of Hirtenberger Patronen-Fabrik, a leading Austrian armaments firm founded by his father, Alexander Mandl. A prominent fascist, Mandl was attached to the Austrofascism and Italian varieties and an opponent of Nazism. In the 1930s he became close to Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the commander of the Austrian nationalist militia ("Heimwehr"), which he furnished with weapons and ammunition. Until 1940, Mandl tried to establish contact with Hermann Göring's office in order to supply Germany with iron. Mandl was married five times. His wives were: Helene Hella Mandl, Née Strauss, born 1899, Vienna to whom he was married at the age of 21- the marriage lasted for six weeks. Hedy Lamarr, Née Kiesler, born 1914, Vienna (see below)They married in 1933 and divorced in 1937 or 1938. Herta Mandl, Née Wrany, born 1911, Steiermark (The LaVoz article suggests she was also known as Schneider, and was with him in Buenos Aires in 1938) They married in 1939 and divorced in 1951. Gloria de Quaranta, Née Vinelli, born 1922, Buenos Aires They married in 1951; she died in 1976. Mandl's last marriage was to his secretary Monika Brücklmeier, daughter of Eduard Brücklmeier, an accessory executed for his involvement in the July 20 plot to assassinate Hitler. From 1933 to 1937, Mandl was married to Austrian actress Hedwig "Hedy" Kiesler, who would later become known as Hedy Lamarr in Hollywood. Both Hedy Lamarr's parents were born Jewish, but her mother converted to Roman Catholicism and Hedy was brought up Catholic. Her first "serious" film was "Algiers" for which she was highly acclaimed at the time. Mandl is rumoured to have attempted to bring a halt to her acting career in Germany and to purchase all copies of her infamous film "Ecstasy" (1933), in which she appeared nude. Following incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany with the Anschluss of 1938, Mandl's remaining property which had not yet been transferred to Swiss ownership was seized, since he had supported the separatist Austrofascism. His then-wife Lamarr wrote in her autobiography "Ecstasy and Me", that both Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and German dictator Adolf Hitler attended Mandl's parties. Lamarr described Mandl as extremely controlling, and wrote that she escaped only by disguising herself as a maid and fleeing to Paris, where she obtained a divorce. Mandl later moved to Brazil and then to Argentina, where he became a citizen and remarried. In Argentina he served as an advisor to Juan Perón and attempted a new role as film producer. He also founded a new airplane manufacturing firm, Industria Metalúrgica y Plástica Argentina. Mandl became a leading member of Argentina's social circles. He acquired homes in Mar del Plata, a castle in Córdoba and a small hotel in Buenos Aires. He worked closely with French designer Jean-Michel Frank, who was then artistic director of Comte S.A., who produced most of Mandl's furnishings. In 1955 he returned to Austria, where he resumed running the factory at Hirtenberg. </doc> <doc id="2343693" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343693" title="Save the World, Lose the Girl"> Save the World, Lose the Girl Save the World, Lose the Girl is the debut studio album by American pop punk band Midtown and was released on Drive-Thru Records on February 15, 2000.

Anderson holds degrees in philosophy from Seattle University (1972) and in law from the University of Denver (1975). He is a member of the bar of the District of Columbia and is admitted to practice law before the U.S. Supreme Court. Anderson has received honorary doctorates from The Catholic University of America (his wife also received an honorary degree at the same ceremony), The Pontifical Theology Academy of Kraków, Sacred Heart University, Albertus Magnus College, Ave Maria University, St. Vincent’s Seminary, St. Charles Borromeo Seminary and Ave Maria Law School. During the administration of Ronald Reagan, Anderson served in various positions of the Executive Office of the President of the United States, including special assistant to the President and acting director of the White House Office of Public Liaison. During that time, he, along with many others in the White House, disagreed with U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop about how to speak about AIDS, writing that "failure to make moral judgments on this behavior is why we have this epidemic." Following his service at the White House, Anderson served for nearly a decade as a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. From 1976-81 he was a legislative assistant to Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). From 1981 to 1983 he served as counselor to the Under Secretary of Health and Human Services at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for Secretaries Richard Schweiker and Margaret Heckler. From 1983 to 1998 Anderson taught as a visiting professor of family law at the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family located at the Pontifical Lateran University. Anderson became the founding vice president and first dean of the Washington, D.C. session of the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies in Marriage and Family in 1988. As Supreme Knight, Anderson is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the world’s largest Catholic family fraternal service organization, which has more than 1.9 million members. Before his election in 2000, Anderson served as assistant supreme secretary and supreme secretary for the Knights of Columbus. Prior to that, he served for 10 years as the vice president for public policy in the Washington, D.C. office of the Knights of Columbus. Anderson is a Knight of St. Gregory the Great, a Knight of the Grand Cross of St. Sylvester, and a Knight of the Grand Cross of the Holy Sepulchre. Anderson was named one of the "100 Most Influential in Business Ethics" in 2014 and 2015 by Ethisphere. He was awarded the Order of Merit from the government of Poland and the "Evangelium Vitae" Medal from the University of Notre Dame in 2015. He has received the Patronal Medal of the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception for his "distinguished service in the advancement of Marian devotion;" the Archdiocese of Denver's "Imago Dei" Award; the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty's Canterbury Medal; the Path to Peace Foundation's Servant of Peace Award; the Pontifical North American College's Rector's Award; the Sisters of Life John Cardinal O'Connor Award, and the Gold Palm of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1998, Pope John Paul II appointed Anderson to the Pontifical Academy for Life and in 2002 to the Pontifical Council for the Laity. In 2003 he was named a consultor to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace.In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI named Anderson as a member of the Pontifical Council for the Family and as a consultor to the Pontifical Council for Social Communications. In 2009, Pope Benedict appointed Anderson to a five-year term on the board of supervisors of the Institute for Works of Religion, also known as the Vatican Bank. In 1994, he was a member of the Vatican delegation for the Fifteenth Meeting of the International Catholic Jewish Liaison Committee held in Jerusalem.

Owned by Bayou City Broadcasting, WEVV maintains studio facilities located on Carpenter and Bond Streets in Downtown Evansville, and its transmitter is located at John James Audubon State Park in Henderson, Kentucky. On cable, WEVV is available in standard definition on WOW! and Charter Spectrum channel 10; and in high definition on WOW! digital channel 810 and Spectrum channel 912. Channel 44 first signed on the air on November 17, 1983, as an independent station. The station was originally owned by Ralph Wilson (owner of San Francisco independent station KICU-TV, and founder of the Buffalo Bills). It was the first full-market independent station in the Tri-State, and the first full-market commercial television station to sign on in the Evansville market since WTVW (channel 7, now a CW affiliate) debuted 27 years earlier in August 1956. Competing independent station WLCN (channel 19, later WAZE-TV and now defunct)—which signed one month after WEVV began operations—primarily served the southern part of the market at the time. The station originally operated from studio facilities located on Main Street and Riverside Drive in downtown Evansville. The station became an affiliate of the Fox Broadcasting Company on April 5, 1987, when the network debuted its inaugural lineup of primetime programming, which aired on Sunday evenings. However, like other Fox stations during the network's early years, WEVV continued to be programmed as a "de facto" independent station, as Fox would not carry seven nights a week of programming until September 1993. Until Fox began airing programming on a nightly basis, WEVV aired movies on nights when network programs did not air, usually starting at 7:00 p.m. Shortly after affiliating with the network, the station began branding as "Fox 44". The station changed its branding to "WEVV Fox TV" in 1994. In May 1995, Banam Broadcasting, a subsidiary of BankAmerica, sold WTVW to Petracom Broadcasting. Fox then acquired a 20% equity stake in Petracom; this led to a three-way affiliation swap in which WTVW ended its affiliation with ABC after 39 years and joined Fox on December 3, 1995. Conversely, the ABC affiliation moved to WEHT (channel 25) ending that station's affiliation with CBS after 41 years. On July 1, 1995, WEVV signed an affiliation agreement with CBS to become the network's new affiliate for the Evansville market. Although CBS' affiliation agreement with WEHT did not expire until December of that year, channel 25 began dropping CBS shows from its schedule in stages. As a result, CBS' programming gradually migrated to WEVV over the next four months, during which the station carried both CBS and Fox programming. "The Price Is Right" was the first CBS program to move to channel 44 on September 18, 1995. WEVV then picked up "CBS This Morning" in November. The switch to CBS was officially completed on December 4, 1995, when the remainder of the CBS programming schedule moved to WEVV. At that point, the station sold much of its syndicated programming inventory to WTSN-LP (channel 56, now Retro Television Network affiliate WYYW-CD on channel 15). On February 11, 1999, Wilson sold the station to Communications Corporation of America for $27.5 million. In June 2006, Comcorp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the Western District of Louisiana. That September, WEVV began broadcasting a digital high definition signal; at the time, a digital subchannel was added on virtual channel 44.2, which was originally affiliated solely with MyNetworkTV and was simulcast on WTSN-LP (and as such, was branded as "MyTSN"). The station's relationship with WTSN-LP ended in 2009, at which time WEVV-DT2 rebranded as "My44", with WTSN converting into an America One affiliate. WEVV-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 44, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 45, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 44. On May 11, 2011, WEVV signed an affiliation agreement with Fox on its second digital channel after WTVW (which then became an independent station) lost its affiliation due to a dispute between Fox and Nexstar over Fox's revenue sharing demands of its stations' retransmission consent earnings—in essence, resulting in WEVV regaining the Fox affiliation it had lost 16 years earlier. WEVV added Fox programming to its second digital subchannel on July 1, 2011 on WEVV digital channel 44.2. Consequently, MyNetworkTV programming—which had been carried on the subchannel since it launched with the programming service on September 5, 2006—was moved from the 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. to 9:00 to 11:00 p.m., immediately following Fox programming. On June 24, 2011, WEVV-TV signed on a new digital low-power translator station on UHF channel 47, under the callsign W47EE-D, to relay WEVV .2's programming in 720p high definition over-the-air in the immediate Evansville/Henderson area. and to provide an HD signal of the subchannel to local cable and satellite providers. On April 24, 2013, Communications Corporation of America announced the sale of its stations to WEHT owner and WTVW operator Nexstar Broadcasting Group for $270 million, in a deal that also included rights to the local marketing agreements involving stations owned by Comcorp partner company White Knight Broadcasting. Since there are fewer than eight full-power stations in the Evansville market, neither Nexstar nor its partner company (and WTVW owner) Mission Broadcasting could legally buy WEVV. Instead, Nexstar originally opted to sell WEVV to Rocky Creek Communications, a Denton, Texas-based company founded by Shirley Green; Nexstar would have operated the station under a shared services agreement, which would have formed a virtual triopoly with WEHT and WTVW. However, the deal came soon after the FCC began closely scrutinizing sharing agreements between two or more television stations within the same market to help increase female and ethnic minority ownership in television broadcasting. When it was apparent the Comcorp sale would be delayed, Nexstar announced on August 4, 2014 that it would instead sell WEVV to The Woodlands, Texas-based Bayou City Broadcasting (owned by DuJuan McCoy, who is African American) for $18.6 million; the sale price later increased to $26.85 million by its closure. The sale was completed on January 1, 2015. On January 8, 2015, WEVV and WEVV-DT2 were removed from Dish Network in the Evansville market, due to a carriage dispute spurred by Bayou City and Dish's inability to agree on retransmission consent revenue during negotiations on a new carriage agreement. Bayou City representatives claimed that Dish was trying to gain leverage over the company in negotiations because of the company's smaller size in comparison to other television station groups. Dish, however, claimed the new owners wanted transmission fees higher than those it pays other local broadcasters. The dispute was resolved on February 3, 2015, through the reaching of a multi-year carriage agreement with Dish Network. On August 3, 2015, upon the relaunch of its news department, WEVV moved its operations to WTVW's former studios on Carpenter Street in Downtown Evansville, which had sat vacant since WTVW mergered operations with WEHT through a shared services agreement in December 2011. On November 11, 2015, the translator's callsign was changed to the current WEEV-LD. The station's digital channel is multiplexed: As WEVV-DT2 is currently in widescreen standard definition, and its high definition simulcast is on a low-power station, Fox programming in HD is only available on cable and satellite outside the immediate Evansville area. WEVV started producing a 9:00 p.m. newscast in 1992 as a Fox affiliate. Once it became a CBS affiliate in 1995, it moved the newscast to 10:00 p.m. and added additional newscasts. However, none of the changes to its newscasts helped the station in the ratings, and WEVV remained continually in fourth place behind WFIE, WEHT and WTVW. Unable to make any ratings headway, WEVV shut down its news department in July 2001, causing the layoffs of 40 staffers. As a result of the shutdown of the original news department, WEVV became one of the few Big Three affiliates that did not air any local newscasts—a group that includes CBS owned-and-operated station WWJ-TV in Detroit, ABC affiliate KDNL-TV in St. Louis and NBC affiliate WTWC-TV in Tallahassee, Florida. In 2002, the station began airing local weather cut-ins on weekday evenings, which were produced by WeatherVision out of its headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi. After Bayou City Broadcasting acquired WEVV, Bayou City president DuJuan McCoy announced on December 9, 2014, that the company planned to relaunch a news department in 2015. The newscasts premiered on August 3, 2015, with the debuts of a new weekday morning news program (initially airing from 4:30 to 7:00 a.m., and is also simulcast on WEVV-DT2/WEEV-LD), a 90-minute news block starting at 5:00 p.m. and half-hour newscasts at noon and 10:00 p.m. on its main channel, which have all been produced in high definition since the return of in-house news operations. In addition to producing local newscasts for its main feed, WEVV also produces separate weekday morning and nightly 9:00 p.m. newscasts for its Fox/MyNetworkTV subchannel. Unlike most CBS affiliates, WEVV carries only a late-evening newscast at 10:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays (with an hour-long weekend newscast at 9:00 p.m. for WEVV-DT2/WEEV-LD) as it did not produce an early-evening or weekend morning newscast at launch. </doc> <doc id="2343703" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343703" title="Deterministic encryption"> Deterministic encryption A deterministic encryption scheme (as opposed to a probabilistic encryption scheme) is a cryptosystem which always produces the same ciphertext for a given plaintext and key, even over separate executions of the encryption algorithm. Examples of deterministic encryption algorithms include RSA cryptosystem (without encryption padding), and many block ciphers when used in ECB mode or with a constant initialization vector. Deterministic encryption can leak information to an eavesdropper, who may recognize known ciphertexts. For example, when an adversary learns that a given ciphertext corresponds to some interesting message, they can learn something every time that ciphertext is transmitted. To gain information about the meaning of various ciphertexts, an adversary might perform a statistical analysis of messages transmitted over an encrypted channel, or attempt to correlate ciphertexts with observed actions (e.g., noting that a given ciphertext is always received immediately before a submarine dive). This concern is particularly serious in the case of public key cryptography, where any party can encrypt chosen messages using a public encryption key. In this case, the adversary can build a large "dictionary" of useful plaintext/ciphertext pairs, then observe the encrypted channel for matching ciphertexts. While deterministic encryption schemes can never be semantically secure, they have some advantages over probabilistic schemes. One primary motivation for the use of deterministic encryption is the efficient searching of encrypted data. Suppose a client wants to outsource a database to a possibly untrusted database service provider. If each entry is encrypted using a public-key cryptosystem, anyone can add to the database, and only the distinguished "receiver" who has the private key can decrypt the database entries. If, however, the receiver wants to search for a specific record in the database, this becomes very difficult. There are some Public Key encryption schemes that allow keyword search, however these schemes all require search time linear in the database size. If the database entries were encrypted with a deterministic scheme and sorted, then a specific field of the database could be retrieved in logarithmic time. Assuming that a deterministic encryption scheme is going to be used, it is important to understand what is the maximum level of security that can be guaranteed. A number of works have focused on this exact problem. The first work to rigorously define security for a deterministic scheme was in CRYPTO 2007. This work provided fairly strong security definitions (although weaker than semantic security), and gave constructions in the random oracle model. Two follow-up works appeared the next year in CRYPTO 2008, giving definitional equivalences and constructions without random oracles , . To counter this problem, cryptographers proposed the notion of "randomized" or probabilistic encryption. Under these schemes, a given plaintext can encrypt to one of a very large set of possible ciphertexts, chosen randomly during the encryption process. Under sufficiently strong security guarantees the attacks proposed above become infeasible, as the adversary will be unable to correlate any two encryptions of the same message, or correlate a message to its ciphertext, even given access to the public encryption key. This guarantee is known as semantic security or Ciphertext indistinguishability, and has several definitions depending on the assumed capabilities of the attacker (see semantic security). </doc> <doc id="2343708" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343708" title="Massachusetts Route 132"> Massachusetts Route 132 Route 132 is a state highway in the town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, part of Cape Cod. The entire length of the highway is also locally signed as part of Iyannough Road. Route 132 is the main link between greater Barnstable and the village of Hyannis, in fact, all of Route 132 lies within the Barnstable city limits, and connects Routes 28 and 6A via an almost straight northwest-southeast course. The southern terminus is at the Airport Rotary in Hyannis, at the intersection of Route 28. Iyanough Road itself begins further east on Route 28 at the Barnstable/Yarmouth border. The southernmost mile contains an immense number of malls and other large shopping centers along the route, such as the Christmas Tree Shops Plaza, Cape Cod Mall, the Capetown (K-Mart) Plaza, the Independence Plaza, and the Festival In Hyannis shopping center. Other restaurants, hotels, car dealerships, and strip malls dot the road densely until the intersection with Phinney's Lane. At Mile 3.0, it crosses underneath Route 6 at Exit 6 (mile 68 of the freeway). Cape Cod's only freeway service plaza is at this intersection. North of the intersection is Cape Cod Community College. The northern terminus of Route 132 is at Route 6A in the village of West Barnstable. Route 132 is notorious for its heavy traffic, especially during summer months. Originally 2 lanes on its entire length when first built, development has necessitated about half of the road's length to be widened to 4 lanes, with another stretch (between Phinney's Lane and US 6) constructed as a divided highway. Part of the original Route 132 was bypassed around Phinney's Lane in the 1960s to straighten out the road and keep traffic moving at a reasonable pace. Locally, the old section is simply known as "Old Route 132," and is officially designated as part of Attucks Lane by the city of Barnstable. The old road grade is on the right and it currently being used as a staging area for construction equipment. </doc> <doc id="2343710" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343710" title="Jake Goldsbie"> Jake Goldsbie Jacob Benjamin "Jake" Goldsbie (born August 8, 1988) is a Canadian actor.

Frank Baum's Oz books, first described in "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" (1900). Munchkin Country is in the East, noted by later being ruled by the Wicked Witch of the East. In "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz", it was originally called "the land of Munchkins", but is referred to as "Munchkin Country" in all subsequent Oz books. Munchkin Country is linked to Oz's imperial capital the Emerald City by means of the yellow brick road. The native inhabitants of this quadrant are called Munchkins. In the story, the novel's protagonist Dorothy Gale, attends a celebration upon her arrival to Oz at the mansion of Boq, who is the friendliest and wealthiest Munchkin man. "Munchkin" does not necessarily mean someone of short stature. Many Munchkins portrayed in the books are of normal height, most notably Nick Chopper (also known as the Tin Woodman). The publishing company Reilly & Britton (later Reilly & Lee) published, in the form of end-papers to the first edition of "Tik-Tok of Oz" (1914), one of the Oz books, the only authenticated map (reproduced here) that shows the Land of Oz in its entirety. For some undiscovered reason this map flip-flops the directions of east and west. The West and East subsection of the Wikipedia article on the Land of Oz discusses this error and the resulting contradictions. The revised version of the map published by the International Wizard of Oz Club corrects the directions and reverses the map. Munchkin Country is distinguished by the color blue, which is worn by most of the Munchkins, as well as the color of their surroundings. While the Eastern part of the Munchkin Country is described as rich, beautiful, fertile and pleasant, and inhabited by friendly people, the Western part of the province (i.e., the region bordered by a large forest and the area surrounding the Emerald City) is wild, rough and dangerous. Certain areas of this land are densely forested, and inhabited by ferocious beasts. Munchkin Country is the site where Dorothy Gale's house lands after being carried to Oz by a cyclone. Munchkin Country's ruler was the Wicked Witch of the East but upon Dorothy's arrival in Oz, she is eliminated when the house lands on top of her, causing much celebration among the Munchkins. Princess Ozma's party visited the King of the Munchkins on their return from the Dominions of the Nome King, and found Jinjur working in his employ. This king also appears briefly in "The Road to Oz". Ruth Plumly Thompson's books identify the king of the Munchkin Country as Cheeriobed. He rules from the Sapphire City in the Ozure Isles, with his wife, Queen Orin, and son, Prince Philador. He is introduced by name in "The Giant Horse of Oz" and makes a subsequent appearance in "The Wishing Horse of Oz". In some of Thompson's Oz books, the geography is inverted, with the Munchkin Country in the Western part of Oz and the Winkie Country in the East. John R. Neill's Oz books name the Scarecrow as king of the Munchkins, although this contradicts the previous books. He is never shown in this capacity; he is simply stated to be so. In "The Patchwork Girl of Oz", it is revealed that parts of the Yellow Brick Road have Man-Eating Plants near them. In Gregory Maguire's novels, "" and "Son of a Witch" (which use "Munchkinland"), the characters are not all Munchkins, and so they are actually called Munchkinlanders. In these books (unlike the more famous movie), Munchkins are generally shorter than average height, though the more powerful families, as Frexspar said, "married into some height along the way." Maguire portrays Munchkinland as the corn belt of Oz. Munchkinland is also shown to be the native home of Elphaba, or the Wicked Witch of the West, and her younger sister Nessarose (although in the novel, they grew up in Quadling Country). In the Broadway musical "Wicked", based on the novel, their father is the governor of Munchkinland. In both adaptations, Nessarose eventually comes to power but her corrupt rule earns her loathing by the Munchkinlanders and the name, "Wicked Witch of the East". Like all the countries of Oz, the Munchkin Country contains various unusual sights, creatures, and places. Among them are: </doc> <doc id="2343712" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343712" title="Archibald Thorburn"> Archibald Thorburn Archibald Thorburn FZS (31 May 1860 - 9 October 1935 Hascombe, Surrey) was a Scottish artist and animal painter and bird illustrator, painting mostly in watercolour. He regularly visited Scotland to sketch birds in the wild, his favourite haunt being the Forest of Gaick near Kingussie in Invernesshire. His widely reproduced images of British wildlife, with their evocative and dramatic backgrounds, are enjoyed as much today as they were by sportsmen and birdlovers of a century ago. Archibald was born at Viewfield House, Lasswade, Midlothian, the fifth son of Robert Thorburn (1818–1885), portrait miniaturist to Queen Victoria. His first education was at Dalkeith and in Edinburgh, after which he was sent to the newly founded St John's Wood School of Art in London. His stay there was only brief, since on the death of his father he sought the guidance of Joseph Wolf. It was his commission in 1887 to illustrate Lord Lilford's "Coloured Figures of the Birds of the British Isles", for which he painted some 268 watercolours, that established his reputation. He illustrated numerous sporting and natural history books, including his own. He taught Otto Murray Dixon and Philip Rickman (both in Nature in Art's collection), and he encouraged the young Donald Watson when he came to visit him in Dumfries and Galloway. Thorburn was friends of other eminent bird illustrators including George Edward Lodge and John Guille Millais with whom he collaborated on a number of works including: "Natural History of British Feeding Ducks"; "British Diving Ducks" and "British Game Birds". His paintings were regularly exhibited at the Royal Academy and he designed their first Christmas card for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1899, a practice that he continued until 1935. He was Vice-President of the "Royal Society for the Protection of Birds". In the 1890s Thorburn became disheartened by the British Institution and had his work shown at A. Baird Carter of 70 Jermyn Street. On his marriage to Constance Mudie, Thorburn moved to "High Leybourne" in Hascombe in 1902, where he was to spend the rest of his life. In the 1930s he refused to make use of electric lighting, preferring natural light for his painting, and making use of lamps and candles. His grave is at St John the Baptist church in Busbridge, Godalming. </doc> <doc id="2343714" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343714" title="Antihumanism"> Antihumanism In social theory and philosophy, antihumanism (or anti-humanism) is a theory that is critical of traditional humanism and traditional ideas about humanity and the human condition. Central to antihumanism is the view that concepts of "human nature", "man", or "humanity" should be rejected as historically relative or metaphysical. In the late 18th and 19th centuries, the philosophy of humanism was a cornerstone of the Enlightenment. From the belief in a universal moral core of humanity, it followed that all persons are inherently free and equal. For liberal humanists such as Kant, the universal law of reason was a guide towards total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. Criticism of humanism as being over-idealistic began in the 19th Century. For Friedrich Nietzsche, humanism was nothing more than an empty figure of speech – a secular version of theism. Max Stirner expressed a similar position in his book "The Ego and Its Own", published several decades before Nietzsche's work. Nietzsche argues in "Genealogy of Morals" that human rights exist as a means for the weak to constrain the strong; as such, they do not facilitate the emancipation of life, but instead deny it. The young Karl Marx is sometimes considered a humanist, as opposed to the mature Marx who became more forceful in his criticism of human rights as idealist or utopian. Marx believed human rights were a product of the very dehumanization they were intended to oppose. Given that capitalism forces individuals to behave in a egoistic manner, they are in constant conflict with one another, and are thus in need of rights to protect themselves. True emancipation, he asserted, could only come through the establishment of communism, which abolishes the private ownership of all means of production. In the 20th century, the view of humans as rationally autonomous was challenged by Sigmund Freud, who believed humans to be largely driven by unconscious irrational desires. Martin Heidegger viewed humanism as a metaphysical philosophy that ascribes to humanity a universal essence and privileges it above all other forms of existence. For Heidegger, humanism takes consciousness as the paradigm of philosophy, leading it to a subjectivism and idealism that must be avoided. Like Hegel before him, Heidegger rejected the Kantian notion of autonomy, pointing out that humans were social and historical beings, as well as Kant's notion of a constituting consciousness. Heidegger nevertheless retains links both to humanism and to existentialism despite his efforts to distance himself from both in the Letter on Humanism (1947). Positivism is a philosophy of science based on the view that in the social as well as natural sciences, information derived from sensory experience, and logical and mathematical treatments of such data, are together the exclusive source of all authoritative knowledge. Positivism assumes that there is valid knowledge (truth) only in scientific knowledge. Obtaining and "verifying" data that can be received from the senses is known as empirical evidence. This view holds that society operates according to general laws like the physical world. Introspective and intuitional attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. Though the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of Western thought, the concept was developed in the modern sense in the early 19th century by the philosopher and founding sociologist, Auguste Comte. Comte argued that society operates according to its own quasi-absolute laws, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws of nature. Humanist thinker Tzvetan Todorov has identified within modernity a trend of thought which emphasizes science and within it tends towards a deterministic view of the world. He clearly identifies positivist theorist Auguste Comte as an important proponent of this view. For Todorov "Scientism does not eliminate the will but decides that since the results of science are valid for everyone, this will must be something shared, not individual. In practice, the individual must submit to the collectivity, which "knows" better than he does." The autonomy of the will is maintained, but it is the will of the group, not the person...scientism has flourished in two very different political contexts...The first variant of scientism was put into practice by totalitarian regimes." A similar criticism can be found in the work associated with the 'Frankfurt School' of social research. Antipositivism would be further facilitated by rejections of 'scientism'; or science "as ideology". Jürgen Habermas argues, in his "On the Logic of the Social Sciences" (1967), that "the positivist thesis of unified science, which assimilates all the sciences to a natural-scientific model, fails because of the intimate relationship between the social sciences and history, and the fact that they are based on a situation-specific understanding of meaning that can be explicated only hermeneutically ... access to a symbolically prestructured reality cannot be gained by observation alone." Structuralism was developed in post-war Paris as a response to the perceived contradiction between the free subject of philosophy and the determined subject of the human sciences; and drew on the systematic linguistics of Saussure for a view of language and culture as a conventional system of signs "preceding" the individual subject's entry into them. Lévi-Strauss in anthropology systematised a structuralist analysis of culture in which the individual subject dissolved into a signifying convention; the semiological work of Roland Barthes (1977) decried the cult of the author and indeed proclaimed his death; while Lacan's structuralist psychoanalysis inevitably led to a similar diminishment of the concept of the autonomous individual: "man with a discourse on freedom which must certainly be called delusional...produced as it is by an animal at the mercy of language". Taking a lead from Brecht's twin attack on bourgeois "and" socialist humanism, Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser used the term "antihumanism" in an attack against Marxist humanists, whose position he considered a revisionist movement. Althusser considered "structure" and "social relations" to have primacy over individual consciousness, opposing the philosophy of the subject. For Althusser, the beliefs, desires, preferences and judgements of the human individual are the product of social practices, as society moulds the individual in its own image through its ideologies. For Marxist humanists such as Georg Lukács, revolution was contingent on the development of the class consciousness of an historical subject, the proletariat. In opposition to this, Althusser's antihumanism downplays the role of human agency in the process of history. Post-structuralists such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida rejected structuralism's insistence on fixed meaning, its privileging of a meta-linguistic standpoint; but continued all the more to problematize the human subject, favoring the term "the decenter-ed subject" which implies the absence of human agency. Derrida, arguing that the fundamentally ambiguous nature of language makes intention unknowable, attacked Enlightenment perfectionism, and condemned as futile the existentialist quest for authenticity in the face of the all-embracing network of signs. He stressed repeatedly that "the subject is not some meta-linguistic substance or identity, some pure "cogito" of self-presence; it is always inscribed in language". Foucault challenged the foundational aspects of Enlightenment humanism, as well as their strategic implications, arguing that they either produced counter-emancipatory results directly, or matched increased "freedom" with increased and disciplinary normatization. His anti-humanist scepticism extended to attempts to ground theory in human feeling, as much as in human reason, maintaining that both were historically contingent constructs, rather than the universals humanism maintained. The heroine of the novel "Nice Work" begins by defining herself as a semiotic materialist, "a subject position in an infinite web of discourses – the discourses of power, sex, family, science, religion, poetry, etc." Charged with taking a bleak deterministic view, she retorts, "antihumanist, yes; inhuman, no...the truly determined subject is he who is not aware of the discursive formations that determine him". However, with greater life-experience, she comes closer to accepting that post-structuralism is an intriguing philosophical game, but probably meaningless to those who have not yet even gained awareness of humanism itself. In his critique of humanist approaches to popular film, Timothy Laurie suggests that in new animated films from DreamWorks and Pixar "the 'human' is now able to become a site of amoral disturbance, rather than – or at least, in addition to – being a model of exemplary behaviour for junior audiences". </doc> <doc id="2343716" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343716" title="Bacitracin/polymyxin B"> Bacitracin/polymyxin B Bacitracin/polymyxin B (trade name Polysporin among others) is a topical antibiotic cream or ointment.

The Type 11 designation was given to this gun as it was accepted in the 11th year of Emperor Taishō's reign (1922). The Type 11 infantry gun entered service in 1922. It was intended to be used against enemy machine gun positions and light tanks, and in a modified form was used to equip some early Japanese tanks (the Japanese Renault NC27 and some early Type 89 I-Go medium tanks). It had been largely been superseded by the Type 94 37 mm anti-tank gun by beginning of the Pacific War. The Type 11 infantry gun was based on the French Canon d'Infanterie de 37 modèle 1916 TRP, for which Japan bought a production license after World War I, and modified it to suit Japanese requirements). It fired from a tubular steel tripod and used a vertically sliding breechblock, that was opened and closed by a lever on the right side of the gun. The gun was fired by pulling sharply on a cord hanging from its rear, which drove a lever into the firing pin, which impacted and initiated the percussion cap in the rear of the shell. It was intended to be carried into action by its gunners using the rear legs of the gun as carrying poles and lacked wheels entirely, with a pair of removable poles at the front allowing four men to lift the weapon. The rear legs of the weapon were fitted with spades to firmly fix the gun in position. The gun fired the Type 12 high-explosive shell, which contained 41 grams of explosive, as well as an ineffective anti-tank shell. The Type 11 infantry support guns were typically assigned in groups of four to combat infantry regiments. Each weapon was manned by a squad of 10 men (a squad leader, four gunners (two of whom stood in reserve a little distance from the gun), three men to carry ammunition and two men who handled the pack horses used with the gun), and was kept in contact with the regimental headquarters (typically up to 300 meters) away by field telephone or messenger runners. The gun was effective in the early stages of the Second-Sino-Japanese War for its intended purpose of providing heavy infantry firepower against semi-fortified positions, such as pillboxes, machine gun nests, and lightly armored vehicles. However, its low muzzle velocity, small caliber and low rate of fire rendered it quickly obsolete against Allied forces equipped with tanks, and it was seldom seen outside of reserve units during the Pacific War. </doc> <doc id="2343730" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343730" title="Galeana"> Galeana Galeana is a common Spanish last name.

A watercolour portrait by Horace Hone (1756–1825) is in the National Galleries of Scotland. His early attempt to set up a merchanting business in Virginia was a failure and he returned to Scotland. After qualifying as a medical doctor he established a successful practice in Liverpool, England and after a few years was able to purchase a small estate in Dumfriesshire. He became a Fellow of the London Medical Society and was a founder member of the Liverpool Literary Society. He was an early advocate of the abolition of slavery and wrote several political letters and pamphlets, including one to William Pitt, which made him a number of enemies. Throughout his life he was dogged by illness and in 1804 he became seriously unwell. In an effort to find a cure, he relinquished his Liverpool practice and went to Bath, Clifton and finally Sidmouth, where he died on 31 August 1805 at age 49. He was born in Kirkpatrick-Fleming, in Annandale, Dumfriesshire, a son of the minister, the Reverend James Currie, and Jane, the only daughter of Robert Boyd, of Dumfries. The Curries were an old Scottish family, descended from the Curries of Dunse, Berwickshire, and originally from the Corrie family of Annandale. James's first school was in the nearby parish of Middlebie, in Annandale, where his father had become Minister, and from age 13 he attended the grammar school in Dumfries, run by Dr George Chapman. After a period in America, described below, he returned in 1776 to Scotland to study medicine at Edinburgh. During his first year at university he contracted rheumatic fever, a disease which recurred periodically throughout his life. He obtained his degree of M.D. in Glasgow and in 1780 settled in Liverpool, where he was appointed as one of the physicians at the infirmary. He married Lucy Wallace in 1783, with whom he had five children. Her father was a prosperous merchant, a descendant of William Wallace, nicknamed "The Hero of Scotland" by Sir Walter Scott. Attracted by the stories of prosperity in America he went in 1771 to Virginia, at that time a British colony, settling as a merchant on the James River, where he spent five hard years, much of the time ill and always in unprofitable commercial business. Trade between Britain and America suffered as a result of the dissension between the two countries and he turned his attention to politics. Under the misleading pseudonym 'An Old Man' he published a series of articles in defence of the right of the mother country to tax her colonies. He was an outspoken man, and his views were unlikely to have enhanced his business prospects. The outbreak of the American Revolution ended any further chance of success and he sailed for home in the spring of 1776. The ship was captured by the revolutionary army. He was made to serve in the Colonial Army, but bought his freedom and made a second attempt to sail to England. He was captured again and this time he had to sail 150 miles in an open boat to gain his freedom. He reached Deptford, England, on 2 May 1777. Dr Currie used cold water treatments in the successful treatment of a contagious fever in Liverpool "and in 1797 made public his views and experiences, with a list of cures effected by his measures". This pamphlet, "Medical Reports on the Effects of Water, Cold and Warm, as a Remedy in Fevers and Other Diseases" (1797), had some influence in promoting the use of cold water affusion, and contains the first systematic record in English of clinical observations with the thermometer. A fourth edition was published in July 1805, the month before his death. In the 1840s, there was a strong revival of interest in cold water cures, or hydropathy, following the promotion of Vincent Priessnitz's methods by Captain R. T. Claridge and others. Yet while acknowledging the contributions of Currie's predecessors, such as John Floyer, Claridge noted that "After all, the merit of settling the use of cold water on just a principle, belongs incontestably to our own countryman, Currie, whose work, published in 1797, upon the efficacy of water, may be considered the scientific base of Hydropathy". Currie was an admirer of Burns's poetry and met him once in Dumfries. One of his wife Lucy's relatives, Mrs Dunlop, was a close friend of the poet. Burns visited Mrs Dunlop at her home on five occasions and over a period of ten years they exchanged a great number of letters, 186 of which survive to this day. After Burns's death, Currie was entrusted with the publication of an authoritative anthology. Although inexperienced in such a task, he had many advantages, including access through Mrs Dunlop to original manuscripts of poems and letters and help from Gilbert Burns, Robert's brother, and several of Burns's friends. When "The Complete Poetical Works of Robert Burns: With Explanatory and Glossarial Notes; And a Life of the Author" was published in four volumes in 1800, it met with immediate success and second, third and fourth editions were published in 1801–3 In addition to containing revised versions of Burns' songs such as "The Battle of Sherramuir", it also contained an introductory criticism and an essay on the character and condition of the Scottish peasantry. The work remains an authoritative source, but not without criticism. It is claimed that Currie exaggerated Burns's fondness for drink and that he deliberately misdated some of Burns's letters to Mrs Dunlop. An eighth edition, published in 1820, included an additional section "Some Further Particulars of the Author's Life" by Gilbert Burns. However, the publishers advised Gilbert not to impugn Currie's accuracy and the legend that Burns was an incurable alcoholic remained unchallenged. </doc> <doc id="2343735" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343735" title="A Lady Without Passport"> A Lady Without Passport A Lady Without Passport is a 1950 American film noir film directed by Joseph H. Lewis and starring Hedy Lamarr and John Hodiak. Written by Howard Dimsdale, the film is about a beautiful concentration-camp refugee who has taken up residence in Cuba while awaiting permission to enter the United States. An undercover immigration agent decides to use her as an informant to entrap the leader of an alien-smuggling ring. This film marked the feature film debut of actor Steven Hill. After World War II, immigrants in Cuba who are refused visas for various reasons try to sneak into the U.S. illegally with the help of a human smuggling ring run by Palinov (George Macready), a Levantine café owner. Following the death of one immigrant, U.S. Immigration operative Pete Karczag (John Hodiak) is sent to Havana, where he poses as a Hungarian in need of Palinov's services. During his dangerous undercover investigation, Pete meets Marianne Lorress (Hedy Lamarr), a penniless Austrian refugee of the Buchenwald concentration camp who is waiting to be smuggled into the United States by Palinov. He decides to use her to obtain the place and time of Palinov's next operation. However Pete falls in love with Marianne, and deducing that she must give herself to Palinov in trade for the trip, talks her into staying in Cuba. Palinov discovers Karczag's true purpose and decides to use his own services. He exposes Pete to Marianne, who angrily decides to go ahead with the smuggling trip. Palinov tries to have Pete killed but the agent overcomes his would-be killer, gets the information from him, and reports it to his superior, Frank Westlake (James Craig). Palinov flies to the United States with Marianne and the other smuggled passengers. However, the airplane is being tracked by U.S. Immigration and is unable to refuel in Florida. Palinov and his pilot crash-land in the Florida Everglades in one last desperate attempt to elude capture. Palinov forces Marianne to accompany him and his pilot, seeking a boat hidden on a river. He kills one of the passengers trying to board their small raft; the rest flee into the glades. Pete and Westlake take up pursuit but split up when Westlake decides that saving the lives of the remaining immigrants takes priority over arresting Palinov. Pete continues after the fugitives and Marianne. The pilot is bitten by a poisonous snake and is left behind. Pete finds the hidden boat and gives it to Palinov in exchange for Marianne, although Palinov treacherously tries but fails to shoot them during his escape. Pete reassures her that Palinov won't get far—Pete emptied the boat's fuel tank before giving it up. The working title of this film was "Visa" and the production dates were early January through late February 1950. According to MGM records the film earned $668,000 in the US and Canada and $336,000 elsewhere, leading to a loss of $444,000. Despite the fact that the film was made on a small budget, most reviews find the "Casablanca"-like film entertaining. When the film was released, the staff at "Variety" magazine praised the film, writing, "Beginning is a bit too cryptic for quick understanding, but when plotline [adapted by Cyril Hume from a suggested story by Lawrence Taylor] does take shape, the story builds and holds attention. Joseph H. Lewis' direction spins it along expertly, neatly pacing the suspenseful sequences." In the 21st century, "Time Out Film Guide" praised director Lewis. "A tight little script and economically etched characters provide a strong foundation, but it is Lewis' evocative visuals that really turn this into a poverty row gem." In 2003, Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review, writing: "Joseph H. Lewis ("Gun Crazy"/"The Big Combo") does his best to make this tightly but uninspiring clichéd film noir work. But even though he adds zest and style by his solid visual directing effort, this low-budget Casablanca wannabe still lacks force. Though this is one of the much praised poverty row director's poorer films, it still is an interesting watch due to the strange effects of the visuals and the surreal atmospheric location shots." The dramatic score for the film, an ethnic Caribbean motif, was composed by David Raksin and conducted by Johnny Green. A suite of Raksin's music that survives on the film's master tape was issued on CD in 2009, on "Film Score Monthly" records. </doc> <doc id="2343738" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343738" title="Jacob Hacker"> Jacob Hacker Jacob Stewart Hacker (born 1971) is the Director of the Institution for Social and Policy Studies and Stanley B. Resor Professor of Political Science at Yale University. Hacker has written works on social policy, health care reform, and economic insecurity in the United States. Hacker was born and raised in Eugene, Oregon. He graduated "summa cum laude" in 1994 from Harvard University with a B.A. in Social Studies, and he received his Ph.D. from Yale in Political Science in 2000. His first book, "The Road to Nowhere: The Genesis of President Clinton's Plan for Health Security", was published in 1996, while he was a graduate student at Yale. Hacker is a media contributor and has testified before the United States Congress. He was widely recognized as a contributor to the health care plans for three of the leading Democratic candidates — Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Edwards — in the presidential election of 2008. Hacker's plan, "Health Care for America," is outlined in a report for the Economic Policy Institute. It proposes providing health care for uninsured or under-insured Americans by requiring employers to either provide insurance to their workers or enroll them in a new, publicly overseen insurance pool. People in this pool could choose either a public plan modeled after Medicare or from regulated private plans. Hacker's work with the international think tank Policy Network has had a major influence on the policies of many European political parties and his concept of pre-distribution has become a cornerstone of the UK Labour Party's economic policy and his name has even been mentioned by Prime Minister David Cameron during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. Hacker was a fellow at New America in 1999 and 2002. In 2007 he co-chaired the National Academy of Social Insurance's conference, "For the Common Good," and oversees a Social Science Research Council project on the "privatization of risk." Hacker's 2010 book, the "New York Times" bestseller "Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Richer Richer--and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class" (Simon & Schuster), written with Paul Pierson of UC Berkeley, argues that since the late 1970s the American middle and working classes have fallen further and further behind economically because policy changes in government favor the rich and super-rich. Their 2016 book "American Amnesia: How the War on Government Led Us to Forget What Made America Prosper" argues for the restoration and reinvigoration of the United States mixed economy. In 2017, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In July 2010 the Economic Security Index was launched. Developed by Hacker and a multi-disciplinary research team with support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the ESI measures the share of Americans who experience at least a 25 percent decline in their income from one year to the next and who lack an adequate financial safety net to replace this lost income. Hacker is married to Oona A. Hathaway, a Professor of Law at Yale University and former Supreme Court clerk to Sandra Day O'Connor. </doc> <doc id="2343740" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343740" title="List of The Dukes of Hazzard episodes"> List of The Dukes of Hazzard episodes This is a list of episodes for the 1979-1985 CBS action-adventure/comedy series "The Dukes of Hazzard".

Gomati starts in the village of Khodiyo Ka Khera(Badisadri)iChittorgarh. It originates in the hills of central Udaipur District, flowing south to join the Som River in the southern part of the district. The river was dammed in the 17th century to create Dhebar Lake, also known as Jaisamand Lake, which has an area of 80 km. </doc> <doc id="2343744" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343744" title="Dhebar Lake"> Dhebar Lake Dhebar Lake (also known as Jaisamand Lake) is India's second-largest artificial lake, after Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar. It is located in the Udaipur District of Rajasthan State in western India. It has an area of when full, and was created in the 17th century, when Rana Jai Singh of Udaipur built a marble dam across the Gomati River. It is about from the district headquarters of Udaipur. When first built, it was the largest artificial lake in the world. The surrounding Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary around Dhebar Lake can be reached by the state highway to Banswara from Udaipur. It is about from Parsad (A village on National Highway No. 8). Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary protects about , mostly teak forest, on the shores of Dhebar Lake. The lake has three islands measuring from each. The Dhebar Lake Marble Dam is long and is a part of the "Heritage Monuments of India". The dam also has the Hawa Mahal Palace, winter Capital of the erstwhile Maharanas of Mewar. Dhebar Lake, built by Maharana Jai Singh in 1685, covers area of . The lake remained the largest artificial lake in the world till the building of the Aswan dam in Egypt by the British in 1902, that was reconstructed between 1960-1970. During the reign of Maharana Jai Singh (1680–1698), there was a great need for water for cultivation in Mewar's southeastern corner. The Maharana emulated his father (Maharana Raj Singh I who built Rajsamand Lake) by damming a small river, the Gomati, and building a massive embankment; the height of the dam is 36.6 meters. Jai Singh named the resultant lake Jaisamand after himself - its often-used nickname is 'Ocean of Victory' ('mand' meaning 'ocean'). On the day of its inauguration, June 2, 1691, Maharana Jai Singh walked around the dam charitably distributing gold equal to his own weight. The statistics of the lake is really amazing – in breadth, deep at its deepest end, a circumference of , with marble staircases leading into the water. The summer palaces of the Queens of Udaipur surround Dhebar Lake on all sides. There are three islands on Dhebar Lake, and the tribe of Bhil Minas (see People of Rajasthan) inhabits all. The two bigger islands are known as Baba ka Magra and the smaller island is called Piari. There is a bund on the lake, which has to be mentioned due to its sheer size – long, high and broad at the base. On the marble dam are six exotic cenotaphs and a Shiva temple in the centre. The northern end of the lake has a palace with a courtyard while its southern end has a pavilion of 12 pillars. The hills to its south have grand palaces that have an excellent view of the lake. Dhebar Lake has elegant steps leading to the water and marble Chhatri (cenotaphs) on its bank with a small Shiv temple that marks the grace of the lake. On either side are the palaces built for the past kings favourite queens. The local tribe "Bhils" still inhabit the islands. Maharaja Jai Singh created Dhebar Lake in the 17th century utilizing the waters of the Gomti River. Encircled by hills and with a number of summer palaces along the shore, the lake is a natural and peaceful haven. There are eleven islands on the lake, some of which provide sanctuary inhabited by several species of migratory birds. Maharana Jai Singh at the time of digging the foundation for Dhebar Lake, celebrated the occasion by giving away gold in charity after a Tuladaan Ceremony. In the lake there are three islands whose inhabitants use Bhels (boats) to reach the shore. On the top of two nearby hillocks are two old palaces constructed by Maharana Jai Singh still exist in great condition. A very fine view of the lake is available from these Great Palaces. Graceful marble chhatris flank the embankment and beautiful summer palaces of the Udaipur queens. A trip to Jaisamand Wildlife Sanctuary allows a close encounter with the rich wildlife in their natural habitat. The fauna include the panther, wild boar, deer, four-horned antelope, mongoose and various species of migratory birds. The sanctuary's ecoregion is that of Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests. </doc> <doc id="2343746" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343746" title="William Beauclerk, 8th Duke of St Albans"> William Beauclerk, 8th Duke of St Albans William Beauclerk, 8th Duke of St Albans (18 December 1766 – 17 July 1825) was the son of Aubrey Beauclerk, 5th Duke of St Albans by his wife Catherine.

Born to Swiss immigrant parents in the Bronx, New York, Abplanalp graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in 1939 (he rescued the school from financial distress in 1978) and studied mechanical engineering at Villanova University. He ran a small machine shop prior to entering the United States Army in 1943. After serving in World War II he worked in his machine shop where he invented a practical aerosol valve that could be mass-produced inexpensively. He began the Precision Valve Corporation in 1949, and, by 1950, 15,000,000 valves had been produced, marking the beginning of his business empire. In 1956, he married Josephine Sloboda. The couple had two children. Later in life he became a Republican and supported many conservative causes. Abplanalp was a close friend and supporter of former US President Richard M. Nixon, Nixon's immediate family, and Nixon's long-time confidant, Charles "Bebe" Rebozo. Mr. Abplanalp owned the lease to Walker's Cay for many years. He supported sports fishing as well as conservation. On at least one occasion he took his Grumman seaplane to the island. Abplanalp and his wife were generous donors to Catholic charities, in recognition of which they were inducted in 1971 into two charitable orders — the Order of Malta and the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1974 University of California at Irvine chemists Frank Sherwood Rowland suggested that long-lived organic halogen compounds, such as the CFCs then widely used to pressurize spray cans, would reach the stratosphere where they would be dissociated by UV light, releasing chlorine atoms. Abplanalp wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements. At the time of Abplanalp's death in Bronxville, New York from lung cancer on August 30, 2003, age 81, he held more than 300 aerosol-related patents.

It was re-released for the PlayStation Network in 2010. The game's protagonist is a young man named Alundra, who learns that he has the power to enter people's dreams. He is shipwrecked on an island, near the village of Inoa, where locals have been suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dream walking ability, Alundra proceeds to try to help the locals. The narrative becomes gradually darker and more twisted as the game progresses, dealing with mature themes such as death, clinical depression, fate, religion, and the essence of human existence. The gameplay involves extensive exploration of the island and various dungeons, with an emphasis on challenging puzzle solving, real-time action combat, and platforming, as well as interaction with non-player characters in the village of Inoa. The main gameplay innovation is a dream walking mechanic, where Alundra can enter people's dreams, with each of the dream levels having its own unique twist based upon the dreamer’s personality and traits. Upon release, "Alundra" earned unanimous critical acclaim as well as some initial commercial success. It was praised for its well-written story and characterization, smooth game mechanics and platforming, challenging gameplay and puzzles, and expansive overworld exploration. A sequel entitled "", which has very little in common with the original "Alundra", was released in . Alundra is considered a spiritual sequel to Climax Entertainment's "Landstalker" on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive. In addition to a similar looking main character, the game's development team consisted of former employees of Climax Entertainment. The gameplay style is top-down action-adventure and is known for containing many extremely difficult puzzles, some of which cannot be accessed if the player progresses further in the game, making some items unattainable. It is also known for its music and dark storyline. A range of terrain and surfaces also add variety, from sand, which causes the player to move more slowly, to lava, which damages the player. Upgrades throughout the game can help the player to overcome many of these obstacles, encouraging exploration. Alundra, the silent protagonist and player character, is an elf from the clan of Elna, the Dreamwalkers. He set out for a place called Inoa because of a recurring dream in which a mysterious figure who calls Alundra "Releaser" tells him that he must save the villagers from the evil of Melzas. The ship carrying Alundra is caught in a storm and is broken in half, leaving most of the crew dead and Alundra drifting unconscious. Alundra is next seen washed ashore to an unknown beach, where a man named Jess finds and rescues him. Jess carries Alundra to his house at the village of Inoa and lets him sleep in his guest room. In the village, Alundra discovers he is a Dreamwalker, which means he has an ability to enter other peoples' dreams, and helps the villagers get rid of the nightmares that have been possessing them. Since Alundra's arrival, bad things begin to happen in the village, with various villagers being murdered in their dreams, which leaves them dead outside of their dreams as well. Some of the villagers eventually start blaming Alundra for what is happening. Another dreamwalker, Meia, from the clan Elna arrives to the city and helps Alundra fight off the nightmares of the villagers. Later in the game, it is revealed that the demon, Melzas, has disguised himself as a god, and he is the source of all the nightmares of the village. His goal is to make the villagers pray for their god, and thus make Melzas himself gain power from their prayers. Ronan, the priest of the village, was also on the side of Melzas and helped him to deceive the villagers, and keep them praying for Melzas, the false god. Once Alundra discovers the truth, he gathers the information and items needed to access Melzas' palace to defeat the demon. After Melzas is destroyed, Alundra and Meia bid farewell to the villagers and depart together, before going their separate ways. The music for Alundra was composed by Japanese composer Kohei Tanaka. The soundtrack contains 28 tracks, of which only the ending theme contains lyrics. The beginning of the soundtrack starts with more peaceful and upbeat music, which compliments the beginning of the game. As the player progresses in the game and the plot gets darker, the music starts to become more grim as well, creating an atmosphere of despair and gloominess surrounding the distressing events unfolding. The game was published by Sony in Japan, Working Designs in North America, and Psygnosis in Europe. More recently, "Alundra" has been made available as a downloadable game on the PSone Classics service for the PlayStation 3. "Alundra" was well received upon release. The game had sold 143,114 copies in Japan by the end of 1997. Following its North American release, Working Designs sold over 100,000 copies of the game in North America within a single month in early 1998. Upon release, the game received unanimous critical applause. It currently has average scores of 86 out of 100 at Metacritic based on 9 reviews, making it the sixth highest-rated PlayStation title of 1997, and 85.4% at GameRankings based on 13 reviews, making it the highest-rated action-adventure title of 1997. Famitsu gave it a 31 out of 40 score. In January 1998, IGN stated, "Never have I been so tested and challenged since the old Genesis adventure title, . And Climax has made Alundra twice as hard, twice as challenging, and twice as good as its LandStalker counterpart." The review further states that it has "a really cool story," "some great music and graphics that totally suit the game," and concludes that "this game is awesome." "Electronic Gaming Monthly" and "GamePro" both selected "Alundra" as the runner-up for their 1997 Best Role-Playing Game of the Year awards, coming second only to "Final Fantasy VII". In 2009, Destructoid's Conrad Zimmerman described "Alundra" as a "fresh and innovative" game and "one of the finest examples of action/RPG gaming." He particularly praised it for featuring "a plot the likes of which I had never seen before in the genre," the strong "writing and characterizations," and the "clever and challenging puzzles." In regards to the PSN release, Platform Nation's Julian Montoya said the game "is very enjoyable and definitely worth playing" as well as stating it is a "long, fun, hard, mildly mature and full of personality adventure." He also notes that it is a "fondly remembered Action RPG", states the puzzles are "extremely" challenging, and praises the "engrossing story" for being "surprisingly mature and dark" while touching on "complex themes like fate, religion, death and the essence of human existence." He concluded that some "refer to it as a classic and I really believe it is." In 2010, Gaming Bolt's George Reith described it as one of the "Awesome Games That Time Forgot", stating that while it looked "more like Zelda than a lot of" "Zelda" games, it had "fiendish puzzles" and a more adult tone, combining a "bright visual aesthetic" with a darker story that is "filled with morbid themes" such as clinical depression and not "afraid to kill off the odd character hear and there," giving it "tension that other RPGs" lacked. He also praised the level design, with "well made" dungeons that require thinking "outside of the box", and the "dream walking" mechanic for giving the "levels a unique twist" based "upon the dreamer’s personality and traits," adding "variety to the game’s locales" and providing insight on the characters, but noted this was balanced by an expansive overworld "full of secrets and side-quests," with "an equal amount of dungeons both inside and outside" of dreams. While Alundra 2: A New Legend Begins holds the same name as Alundra, it is only a spiritual successor, having no ties with the original game. </doc> <doc id="2343778" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343778" title="Judith Thompson"> Judith Thompson Judith Clare Thompson, OC (born September 20, 1954) is a Canadian playwright who lives in Toronto, Ontario. She has twice been awarded the Governor General's Award for drama, and is the recipient of many other awards including the Order of Canada, the Walter Carsen Performing Arts Award, the Toronto Arts Award, The Epilepsy Ontario Award, The B'nai B'rith Award, the Dora, the Chalmers, the Susan Smith Blackburn Award (a global competition for the best play written by a woman in the English Language) and the Amnesty International Freedom of Expression Award, both for Palace of the End, which premiered at Canadian Stage, and has been produced all over the world in many languages. She has received honorary doctorates from Thorneloe University and, in Nov. 2016, Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Thompson was born in Montreal, Quebec, the daughter of W. R. Thompson, a geneticist and the head of the Department of Psychology at Queen's University, and Mary, who taught in the Queens Drama Department for many years. She is also the sister of Bill Thompson, a Professor of Psychology who composed the music for a number of Judith's radio and stage plays. Thompson was raised in Middletown, Connecticut and then Kingston, Ontario. She studied drama at Queen's and then studied acting at the National Theatre School of Canada (NTS) in Montreal. Thompson worked as an actor for a while, but then concentrated on playwrighting. While in a mask class at NTS, Thompson developed the character Theresa, a mildly mentally handicapped Aboriginal woman based on people she had met while working as an assistant social worker during summers in Kingston, Ontario. This character was to provide the core of Thompson's first play "The Crackwalker" (1980), which focuses on Kingston's sub-proletariat class. In 1991, CBC reviewer, Jerry Wasserman called the Vancouver Fringe Festival production, "The Diamond among the pebbles ... Maybe the most powerful play ever written in Canada about two down and out couples in Kingston Ontario living on the edge, the outer edge of respectability, and trying to make some sense of their lives – to find love and a kind of domestic normality under the worst conceivable conditions. It's a very, very disturbing play and I think a deeply tragic play about the lowest depths one can imagine in a Canadian city." About a Vancouver production at the Firehall Arts Centre in 1993, The Vancouver Sun's Barbara Crook wrote, "The Crackwalker is not theatre for the timid. Judith Thompson’s first play is a graphic, harrowing glimpse at life on the edge, at individuals battered by poverty, ignorance and hopelessness. It is also a brilliant piece of stagecraft that makes use of every well-chosen word and powerfully dramatic moment to force audience members to confront their own darker sides. If you're looking for theatre that takes you to the edge of hell, The Crackwalker fits the bill." Thompson's second play, "White Biting Dog" (1984), was an expressionistic and poetic black comedy about an eccentric and wildly self-destructive family. "I Am Yours" (1987), while containing similarly expressionistic elements, attaches these to the fears and fantasies of the central characters, to create an even more powerfully compelling theatrical experience. "Lion in the Streets" (1990) uses a structure similar to Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde to follow violent and cruel impulses from one character to another, a route which the ghost of a young murdered girl, Isobel, uses to track down her killer. A penultimate scene which Thompson cut after the first workshop production of the play, was restored for the 1999 Theatre Kingston production, and Thompson has since then included the scene in published editions of the play as one of two alternative versions. Productions of the play have been held in a wide variety of North American locations, including Toronto, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Portland and Vancouver, but also Łódź, Poland. In 1991, Thompson adapted and directed Henrik Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" for the Shaw Festival. A remount of Thompson's adaptation appeared at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in 2005. Her adaptation was also performed at the Mainline Theatre in Montreal in February 2008. Her translation of Serge Boucher's "Motel Hélène" appeared at the Tarragon Theatre in 2001. "Sled" (1997), which began life as a seven-hour play called "The Last Things", but was later cut down to three hours, attempts again to pursue human violence back to its sources. Thompson first wrote Perfect Pie as a short monologue for television in 1993, but in 2000 expanded the story into full-length play about two teenaged girls whose lives diverge dramatically after a violent incident. In 2002, "Perfect Pie" was also made into a feature film of that name, which, while satisfying in itself, offered a more conventional version of the uncanny story told in Thompson's play. "Habitat", which premiered in 2001 at CanStage, the major regional theatre in Toronto, shows how a middle-class community is torn apart into factions when a group home for troubled youth is established on a quiet residential street. "Capture Me", which premiered in early 2004 at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto, is centred on a kindergarten teacher who, while searching for her birth mother, is stalked by her violent ex-husband. Such Creatures premiered at Theatre Passe Muraille in 2011, and The Thrill premiered at the Stratford Festival in 2013. She wrote and performed her play Watching Glory Die in 2014, premiering at The Cultch in Vancouver, and then produced at the Berkley Street Theatre later that year. In 2007 Thompson created the play Body and Soul with 14 women between the ages of 45 and 80, about women and aging, using the performers own words and experiences. The play premiered at Soulpepper, and then had a second production at the Tarragon the following year. The Vancouver Olympics brought the play there during the Para Olympics, to great acclaim. The success of this verbatim play inspired Thompson to create a play with 9 performers with Down Syndrome for the Fringe Festival of 2012, called Rare. It was a hit of the Fringe, and then was invited by Albert Shultz of Soulpepper to be part of "Winter at the Young." It was a sold out hit which extended three times, and toured to several places. It was then that the rare theatre company was formed (raretheatre.org) Judith Thompson is the artistic director of this theatre, which is dedicated to giving a theatrical platform to those communities which are rarely heard and seldom seen on our stages. The company then went on to produce a play with 9 artists who use wheelchairs. The play was called Borne, and played at Soulpepper in the summer of 2014, again, to sold out houses. In the spring of 2015, Rare Theatre was awarded a Trillium grow grant, which has enabled the company to develop three new projects with differently abled and BIPOC artists. Rare theatre is partnering with Story Planet to create workshops with children, eventually leading towards a full verbatim production which will be called The Children Speak. Thompson's work embraces visceral and subconscious elements of human experience which are seldom seen on stage. While the ambitiousness of her scope can occasionally result in plays which seem somewhat unwieldy in their form, she has an astonishing gift for providing theatrical experiences which incisively reach the deepest recesses of her audience's imaginations. She is currently a Professor of theatre studies at the University of Guelph, in the School of English and Theatre Studies. Thompson won the Governor General’s Award for Drama in 1985 for her play "White Biting Dog", and in 1989 for a collection of her plays, "The Other Side of the Dark." She has won a Toronto Arts Award and the Canadian Authors Association Award. She is the recipient of several Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Awards, including one in 1987 for "I Am Yours," and in 1991 for "Lion in the Streets." "Tornado" won an award for Best Radio Drama in 1988. Thompson has received several Dora Mavor Moore Awards from the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts. In 2005, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada, and in 2007 she was awarded the Walter Carsen Prize for Excellence in the Performing Arts by the Canada Council for the Arts. In 2008 she became the first Canadian to be awarded Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, which recognizes outstanding women playwrights each year. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in sacred letters by Thorneloe University. </doc> <doc id="2343784" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343784" title="Gnophkeh"> Gnophkeh The Gnophkehs are a fictional race in the Cthulhu Mythos. They are humanoid cannibals described as being covered in coarse, matted hair with large protruding ears and proboscidean noses. They originally lived in Hyperborea and worshiped the Great Old One Rhan-Tegoth. But Rhan-Tegoth eventually forgot them when he entered a stone-like hibernation state. They were invaded and driven to the land of Lomar by the Tsathoggua-worshipping Voormis. "The papyrus reputedly preserved the darkest secrets of the occult wisdom of the detested Gnophkehs, which name denoted the repulsively hirsute cannibals whom Yhemog's ancestors had driven into exile in the arctic barrens. This scroll contained, in fact, the most arcane and potent ceremonials whereby the Gnophkehs had worshipped [sic] their atrocious divinity, who was no less than an avatar of the cosmic obscenity Rhan-Tegoth, and was attributed to Morloc himself, the Grand Shaman."<br>— Lin Carter and Clark Ashton Smith, "The Scroll of Morloc" Later on they were again invaded by humans from Zobna and driven even further up north. It was there that Ithaqua, the wind-walker, appeared, to whom the Gnophkhehs transferred their allegiance. They started to harass the Voormis again as they grew in power contributing to the demise of the Voormis civilization. The Gnophkehs in Lomar were eventually destroyed when Ithaqua and Aphoom-Zhah brought about the Ice Age along with the remnants of the Voormis in Hyperborea and the human civilization in Zobna. Often confused with the humanoid Gnophkehs, the Gnoph-keh (note the hyphen) refers to a species of non-humans which dwell in Hyperborea (present-day Greenland). They are violent, hairy, demonic entities with an affinity for cold, ice, and snow. Artwork portrays them as similar to very large six-legged polar bears, with a narwhal-like horn. Their existence is entwined with the humanoid Gnophkehs who worshiped them as totemic mediators with Ithaqua. They might also be further linked with Rhan-Tegoth and Aphoom-Zhah. </doc> <doc id="2343786" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343786" title="John Kyrle"> John Kyrle John Kyrle (22 May 1637 – 7 November 1724), known as "the Man of Ross", was an English philanthropist, remembered for his time in Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire. Born in the parish of Dymock, Gloucestershire, he was the son of Walter Kyrle, a barrister and MP. The family had lived at Ross for many generations. His grandfather, James Kyrle of Walford Court, had been High Sheriff of Herefordshire and whose father, Walter, had spelled the surname Crull which had been a common surname among the Norman aristocracy that had dominated England and a name which gradually disappeared with the Anglo-French aristocracy's anglicisation. James Kyrle's wife, Ann, was the sister of the poet Edmund Waller and her maternal uncle was the statesman John Hampden. John Kyrle was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, matriculating in 1654. He then studied Law at the Middle Temple, but was not called to the bar. He inherited the family estate including a house overlooking the market at Ross, where he lived. From his early twenties he adopted a frugal lifestyle and instead of utilising his wealth for himself, he sought to invest in the greater good of his locality and community that lived there. In everything that concerned the welfare of the small town of Ross in which he lived he took a lively interest; in the education of the children and in improving and embellishing the town. He planted trees in and around the town, with two or three workmen to assist with the manual work. He delighted in mediating between those who had quarrelled and in preventing costly lawsuits between prominent townspeople. He was generous to the poor and spent all he had in good works. He was behind the establishment of 'The Prospect' in Ross in 1700. The public garden on the hilltop just above Ross town centre was laid out with a viewpoint, walkways and a public fountain to provide clean water for town residents. This piece of land was rented off the Marquess of Bath in 1696 and turned into a garden and walking area. The park is still there, alongside the churchyard of St Mary's , with ornate stone gates and mature trees interspersed with benches and a walk. Kyrle lived a great deal in the open air, working with the labourers on his farm and taking exercise to stay healthy. He died on 7 November 1724, having lived to the age of 87, and was buried in the chancel of Ross Church. His name is commemorated throughout Ross-on-Wye, not only in The Prospect but in the 'Man of Ross' public house on Wye Street and his market square townhouse. The town's secondary school carries his name. His memory was also preserved by the Kyrle Society, founded in 1876 by Miranda and Octavia Hill, to better the life of working people, by laying out parks, encouraging house decoration, window gardening and flower growing. The Society was one of the first civic amenity bodies and a progenitor of the National Trust. Ross and John Kyrle were eulogised by Alexander Pope in the third of his "Moral Essays" "Of the Use of Riches" (1734); "Who taught that heav’n directed Spire to rise?<br> "The Man of Ross, each lisping babe replies.<br> "Behold the Market-place with poor o'erspread!<br> "He feeds yon Alms-house, neat, but void of state,<br> "Where Age and Want sit smiling at the gate;<br> "Him portion’d maids, apprentic’d orphans blest,<br> "The young who labour, and the old who rest.<br> "Is any sick? the Man of Ross relieves,<br> "Prescribes, attends, the med’cine makes, and gives,<br> "Is there a variance? enter but his door,<br> "Balk’d are the Courts, and contest is no more.<br> "Despairing Quacks with curses fled the place,<br> "And vile Attornies, now a useless race." and by Coleridge in an early poem of 1794. </doc> <doc id="2343789" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343789" title="Armenian Highlands"> Armenian Highlands The Armenian Highland (; also known as the Armenian Upland, Armenian plateau, Armenian tableland, or simply Armenia) is the central-most and highest of three land-locked plateaus that together form the northern sector of the Middle East. To its west is the Anatolian plateau which rises slowly from the lowland coast of the Aegean Sea and converges with the Armenian Highland to the east of Cappadocia. To its southeast is the Iranian plateau, where the elevation drops rapidly by about to above sea level. The Caucasus extends to the northeast of the Armenian Highland. To the southwest of the Armenian Highland is Upper Mesopotamia. During the Iron Age, the region was known by variations of the name "Ararat" ("Urartu", "Uruatri", "Urashtu"). During Antiquity, it was known as "Armenia Major," a central region to the history of Armenians, and one of the four geo-political regions associated with Armenians, the other three being Armenia Minor, Sophene, and Commagene. The highland is divided into western and eastern regions, defined by the Ararat Valley where Mount Ararat is located. The region to the west of the Ararat Valley, which was conventionally called "Western Armenia", is now officially called "Eastern Anatolia" by Turkey, and the region to the east, which was conventionally called "Eastern Armenia," is now referred to as "Lesser Caucasus" or "Caucasus Minor." The region was historically mainly inhabited by Armenians, and minorities of Assyrians, Georgians, Jews, Greeks, and Iranians. During the Middle Ages, Arabs and particularly Turkmens and Kurds settled in large numbers in the Armenian Highland. The Christian population of the western half of the region was exterminated during the Armenian Genocide of 1915 and on a smaller scale the Assyrian Genocide. Today, the eastern half is mainly inhabited by Armenians, Azerbaijanis, and Georgians, while the western half is mainly inhabited by Azerbaijanis, Kurds (including Yazidis), Turks, and Zazas, with a minority of Assyrians. The Armenian Highland is part of the Alpide belt, forming part of the Asian range that stretches from the Pontic Mountains to the Malay Peninsula. Its total area is about 400,000 km. Historically, the Armenian Highlands have been the scene of great volcanic activity. Geologically recent volcanism on the area has resulted in large volcanic formations and a series of massifs and tectonic movement has formed the three largest lakes in the Highland, Lake Sevan, Lake Van and Lake Urmia. The Armenian Highland is rich in water resources. Most of the Armenian Highland is in eastern Turkey, and also includes northwestern Iran, all of Armenia, southern Georgia, and western Azerbaijan. Its northeastern parts are also known as Lesser Caucasus, which is a center of Armenian culture. From 4000 to 1000 BC, tools and trinkets of copper, bronze and iron were commonly produced in this region and traded in neighboring lands where those metals were less abundant. It is also traditionally believed to be one of the possible locations of the Garden of Eden. The Armenian Plateau has been called the "epicenter of the Iron Age", since it appears to be the location of the first appearance of Iron Age metallurgy in the late 2nd millennium BC. In the Early Iron Age, the Kingdom of Van controlled much of the region, until it was overthrown by the Medes and Orontid dynasty. In Gilgamesh, the land of Aratta is placed in a geographic space that could be describing the Armenian plateau.Throughout Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages, during various centuries, the Armenian Highland was a heavily contested territory of the Iranian Parthian Empire, Sassanid Persian Empire, Byzantine Empire, and the Arab Caliphate. From the early modern era and on, the region came directly under Safavid Iranian rule. Heavily contested for centuries between the Iranian Safavids and its vying archrival the Ottoman Empire with numerous wars raging over the region, large parts of the Highland comprising Western Armenia were finally conquered by the Ottoman Empire in the first half of the 17th century following the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39) and the outcoming Treaty of Zuhab, while Eastern Armenia, forming another major part of the Highlands, stayed in Iranian hands up to the course of the 19th century, when it was ceded to Imperial Russia. During the later first half of the 19th century, the Ottoman held parts of the Armenian Highland comprising Western Armenia now formed the boundary of the Ottoman sphere of influence and the Russian sphere of influence, the latter who had just recently completed its conquest of the Caucasus and Eastern Armenia at the expense of its suzerain, Qajar Iran, in about 4 major wars spanning more than two centuries.According to Richard Hovannisian, the Armenian Genocide was the "physical elimination of the Armenian people and most of the evidence of their ever having lived on the great highland called the Armenian Plateau, to which the perpetrator side soon assigned the new name of Eastern Anatolia". Since the Armenian Genocide and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire after World War I, it has been the boundary region of Turkey, Iran and the Soviet Union and, since the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, Armenia, and parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan. The apricot was known by the Romans as the "prunus armenicus" (the Armenian plum) and was brought to Europe from the Armenian plateau. </doc> <doc id="2343791" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343791" title="William of Saint-Amour"> William of Saint-Amour William of Saint-Amour was a minor figure in thirteenth-century scholasticism, chiefly notable for his withering attacks on the friars. William was born in Saint-Amour, Jura, then part of the Duchy of Burgundy, in c. 1200. Under the patronage of the Count of Savoy, he was active at the University of Paris from the 1220s, becoming master of arts in 1228. From a reference in a letter by Gregory IX, it is evident that he had become a doctor of Canon law by 1238. By 1250 he had been made master of theology. The controversy on which his fame rests began in earnest in the 1250s. The gradual encroachment of the newly formed mendicant orders into the university was the immediate cause of this. The secular clergy had previously enjoyed unrivalled teaching privileges at Paris, but the friars presented a serious challenge to their monopoly, gaining a number of prominent lecturing posts: the career of Bonaventure is indicative of the friars' rising stature in academia. The seculars bitterly resented this incursion, and engaged in a prolonged conflict with the friars. According to Matthew Paris' "Chronica Majora", this controversy brought the university to a point of near-collapse, 'exposed to danger, owing to the suspension of its lectures and disputations, and the dispersion of many of its scholars...owing to the insults and reproaches of the Preachers and Minors'. Particularly offensive was the friars' desire to increase the number of teaching positions, entirely against established custom. At length the dispute was brought before the papal curia. William had emerged as the mouthpiece of the secular party, and in 1254 he and five other masters directly petitioned Innocent IV. The pope proved sympathetic to their concerns: Innocent duly limited many of the friars' powers, and reduced the number of chairs they could legitimately occupy at the university. This victory, however, was short-lived. Innocent died in the December of the same year, and was replaced by Alexander IV. Alexander was cardinal protector of the Franciscans and therefore unlikely to side with the seculars: he promptly overturned the restrictions imposed by his predecessor, allowing the friars to be readmitted to Paris. Hostilities resumed immediately, and William began to produce some of his most sustained and vitriolic sermons and treatises. As might be expected, his campaign against the regulars was not tolerated for long. In 1255 Pope Alexander ordered an inquiry into William's orthodoxy, resulting in his suspension from all teaching and administrative duties. In 1256 William produced "De periculis novissimorum temporum" (On the Dangers of the Final Days), a vicious tirade against the friars, and the culmination of his antifraternal thought. This ridiculed the more extreme eschatological speculations of some friars (e.g., Gerard da Burgo Santo Donnino, author of the "Introductorius ad Evangelium Aeternum"), who alleged that the fraternal orders would usher in the third and final age of the world, a glorious era of the Holy Spirit. "De Periculis" implied that the friars would indeed be instrumental in precipitating the end of the world, but only because they would facilitate the coming of the Antichrist. The treatise attracted written opposition from Thomas Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, both Dominican friars, and was examined by a curial committee. Thomas Aquinas wrote Contra Impugnantes to rebut William's charges. In 1257 Alexander ordered William's treatise to be burned: he also excommunicated William, and exiled him from France. Upon Alexander's death in 1266, William returned to Paris, although does not appear to have been reinstated at the university. He died at Burgundy in September 1272. William's major work had an influence far beyond the compass of his own lifetime. It became the fountainhead of a long polemical tradition. Its most important section consists of thirty-nine 'signa' (or forty-one, in some versions) by which 'false Apostles' may be known. Although it is never openly stated, these 'signs' describe the behaviour of friars. The signs are, in order: William decorates these imputations with various allusions to the Benedictine Rule, the Pauline epistles and Acts of the Apostles. The friars are variously likened to ravening wolves ("lupi graves"), stealers into people's homes ("penetrantes domos"), idlers and meddlers ("otiosos et curiosos"), aimless wanderers ("gyrovaguos") and, most recurrently, false preachers ("pseudo-praedicatores"). In Penn Szittya's phrase, this set of accusations and themes formed an enduring 'symbolic language', one that persisted among the friars' opponents for the next three centuries. In France, William's attacks were reiterated in the Parisian disputes of 1354, when two prominent bishops delivered diatribes against the friars; they also directly stimulated the satires of Rutebeuf and Jean de Meun. In Ireland, his arguments formed the backbone of Richard Fitzralph's "Defensio Curatorum", a much-copied and widely circulated sermon of 1350. In Scotland, Dunbar and Robert Henryson drew on William's motifs; in Germany, the Lutheran pamphleteers Johann Eberlin von Gunzburg and Heinrich Spelt made much use of his ideas. William's work proved especially influential in England, where one of his earliest supporters, a Master Laurence, appears to have been active. The work of Langland, John Gower and Chaucer directly echoes "De Periculis", while its key ideas were assimilated into Lollard ideology from Wyclif onwards (see especially Pierce the Ploughman's Crede). William's ideas even re-emerge in the Protestant writings of William Tyndale, John Bale and John Foxe, whose "Actes and Monuments" quotes "De Periculis" in its entirety. Although his own struggle against the friars ended in abject failure, William's legacy was thus extremely far-reaching. He powerfully stigmatised one of the dominant factions in the late medieval church, providing generations of critics with an arsenal of ready-made indictments.

Geltner, Dallas Medieval Texts and Translations 8 (Louvain and Paris: Peeters, 2007).

Geary was elected Mayor in 1910, re-elected in 1911 and acclaimed in 1912. He resigned in October 1912 in order to accept a position as the City of Toronto's legal counsel. During his term in office he announced plans for a new Harbor board. Geary said, "We have a magnificent harbor but we have failed miserably to avail ourselves of nature's generosity. We have barely sufficient wharfage to accommodate the lake traffic today, to say nothing of the future. We have been to neglectful of our shipping and harbor interests." In 1925 he was elected as a member of parliament as a Conservative from the riding Toronto South and remained an MP until 1935. In 1935 he briefly served as the Minister of Justice in the Cabinet of R.B. Bennett and accordingly became a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. He and the Bennett government were defeated in the 1935 federal election. Geary attempted to regain a seat in the 1940 federal election but was defeated by Arthur Roebuck. He died in Toronto on April 30, 1954, aged 80. He was buried in the St. James Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario. In 1990, his former residence was declared a historic site by the province, naming the home "Geary House". In 1912 Geary was the namesake for a tugboat, built for the city of Toronto, named the "G. R. Geary". </doc> <doc id="2343798" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343798" title="Metropolismania"> Metropolismania Metropolismania (known in Japan as Machi-ing Maker) is a PlayStation 2-only city-building game developed by Indi and published by Media Factory in Japan, Natsume in North America, and Ubisoft in Europe. The object of the game is to interact with NPCs in order to populate various towns. The game was released under a traditional CD-ROM format, uncommon to the PS2. A sequel was announced by Natsume, titled Metropolismania 2 (Machi-ing Maker 2: Zoku Boku no Machi Zukuri in Japan). The title was released on August 28, 2007 in North America and in Japan on July 13, 2006 by D3 Publisher. Another sequel, Metropolismania 3, was released for the PlayStation Portable by D3 Publisher but in Japan only. Several titles under the name "Machi-Ing maker" have also been published for the Nintendo DS and the PlayStation 3. There are various goals to complete in each of the five main scenarios. Goals always involve growing the town to a given population, and often ensuring that a percentage of the buildings are of a certain type, i.e. businesses, farms, or amusement facilities. There are also side stories that occur within each scenario, sometimes including bizarre instances involving smuggling rings, a cult, and even aliens. When all requirements for the scenario have been met, the player's boss will call to congratulate them and send a letter of resignation, allowing the player to move on to the next scenario. Gameplay also centers heavily on interaction with the in-game characters. Each character has a friendship meter that increases or decreases based on interactions such as "gossip" and giving gifts. Relationship statuses are: "stranger," "know the face," "acquaintance," "friend," and "best friend." Introducing new citizens or solving complaints is often based on good friendship status with these characters. There are several categories of characters in the game. Visually, characters within a category may have some variation, from the color of their hair to their clothing. Knowing personality types also aids the player in the game as certain conversational or "gossip" items more quickly increase the friendship meter. Some characters, as described within the game, include: For "Metropolismania 2", there are universal categories of characters in the game.

It is owned by New Dream Network, LLC, founded in 1996 by Dallas Bethune, Josh Jones, Michael Rodriguez and Sage Weil, undergraduate students at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, California, and registered in 1997 by Michael Rodriguez. DreamHost began hosting customers' sites in 1997. In May 2012, DreamHost spun off Inktank. Inktank is a professional services and support company for the open source Ceph file system. In November 2014, DreamHost spun off Akanda, an open source network virtualization project.As of February 2016, Dreamhost employs about 200 employees and has close to 400,000 customers. DreamHost's shared, VPS, and dedicated hosting network consists of Apache, nginx and lighttpd web servers running on the Ubuntu operating system. DreamHost also offers cloud storage and computing services for entrepreneurs and developers, launched in 2012. The control panel for users to manage all services is a custom application designed in-house, includes integrated billing and a support ticket system, and has received rave reviews from some customers. DreamHost's staff contribute to an official blog and a customer support wiki. DreamHost does not offer call-in phone support, but customers can pay extra to request callbacks from support staff. Furthermore, a live chat option is available for all accounts when the level of support emails is low. This option is always available for customers that already pay the monthly fee for callbacks. The company hosts in excess of one million domains. In 2006, the company began a beta version file hosting service they called "Files Forever". The company stated that existing customers could store files "forever" after paying a one-time storage fee, and redistribute or sell them with DreamHost handling the transactions. As of November 2012, this service was no longer offered to new customers. In April 2013, DreamHost mentioned that the Files Forever service had been discontinued and that they would focus on building a better-supported storage technology. In 2009, the company began offering free web application hosting. With either their own domain or a free subdomain, customers are able to make use of a number of open source applications, such as WordPress and MediaWiki without charge. The service is similar to, and can be integrated with, the Google App Engine. Through a control panel, customers are able to manage their applications or upgrade to the standard, fully managed hosting service. DreamHost's DreamCompute is a public cloud computing service that provides scalable compute resources for developers and entrepreneurs. DreamCompute users select the amount of compute resources and storage resources needed and define their own virtual networks. DreamCompute is powered by OpenStack and Ceph and is designed for scalability, resiliency, and security. DreamCompute provides virtual servers through the use of the KVM hypervisor. Virtual machines (VMs) can be started by creating an Instance using the DreamCompute dashboard. The DreamCompute dashboard is built with OpenStack's Horizon project. The dashboard provides a user interface for interacting with DreamCompute's three main services: Compute, Networking, and Storage. Functions such as launching an instance, creating storage volumes, and configuring a virtual network, as well as creating and managing snapshots of both a running instance and storage volumes, are done in the dashboard. DreamCompute leverages OpenStack APIs for system automation. DreamHost’s DreamObjects is a cloud storage service powered by Ceph. Ceph’s distributed object storage system allows for storing DreamObjects’ data on multiple disks across multiple servers for high fault-tolerance. DreamObjects users store any kind of data (developer content, video, music, etc.) and make it accessible from anywhere in the cloud. Because data is redundantly stored across multiple locations, a fault in any part of the redundant system – such as the loss of a server – will go unnoticed by users, as a user’s data remains available and accessible. Commonly used by developers needing object storage to augment or replace S3 or Swift functionally via API, DreamObjects will scale to let a user store any capacity of data. DreamObjects costs are usage based, with no costs upfront. DreamPress is DreamHost’s managed WordPress hosting offering that features WordPress-optimized servers and support for novice and advanced WordPress users. In May 2015, DreamHost released DreamPress 2, featuring the deployment of high-speed Solid State Drives. DreamHost was involved throughout the evolution of OpenStack, contributing developers and engineers to the project beginning in early 2011. DreamHost development team members have been leaders on a number of major OpenStack projects, and have over 1,200 code commits changing over 128,000 lines of OpenStack code. DreamHost CEO Simon Anderson has been on OpenStack’s Board of Directors since the OpenStack Foundation’s inception. In January 2015, DreamHost was elected by Gold members of the OpenStack Foundation to represent for a third consecutive year. In May 2012, DreamHost spun off Inktank. Inktank is a professional services and support company for the open-source Ceph storage system. Inktank was acquired by Red Hat in April 2014 for $175 million. In November 2014, DreamHost spun off Akanda, an open source network virtualization project for OpenStack clouds, into a separate company. On July 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice was granted a federal search warrant ordering DreamHost to hand over IP addresses and other personally identifiable data from visitors to disruptj20.org, a website that helped organize anti-Trump protests on and around Inauguration Day 2017. The Electronic Frontier Foundation said in a blog entry there was "no plausible explanation" for such a warrant and asserted it violates the Fourth Amendment. DreamHost went to court, seeking to narrow the scope of the warrant, and in October 2017, Chief Judge Robert E. Morin, of the District of Columbia Superior Court, did just that, ordering that the DOJ could execute its warrant, but that "it does not have the right to rummage through the information contained on DreamHost's website and discover the identity of, or access communications by, individuals not participating in alleged criminal activity, particularly those who were engaging in protected First Amendment activities." </doc> <doc id="2343805" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343805" title="Adrian Chiles"> Adrian Chiles Adrian Chiles (born 21 March 1967) is a British television and radio presenter, currently working for BBC Radio 5 Live. Previously, Chiles co-presented both "The One Show" (2007–2010) and "Daybreak" (2010–2011) with Christine Lampard. He was also the chief presenter for football coverage on ITV Sport from 2010 until 2015. His journalistic training and love of football resulted in his presenting business programmes such as "Working Lunch" and "The Money Programme" as well as sports programmes like "Match of the Day 2". Chiles was born in Quinton, Birmingham, to an English father and Croatian mother, and moved a few miles away to Hagley, Worcestershire at the age of four. A feature of his presentations is his Birmingham accent. He also speaks Croatian, despite having a self-confessed imperfect understanding of the language's verbs, declensions, and cases. Chiles started his education at Haybridge High School, and then worked in his father's scaffolding business, before graduating with a degree in English literature from the University of London (studying at Westfield College, now part of Queen Mary, University of London). Before going to university he was a keen amateur actor, appearing in the Crescent Theatre (Birmingham)'s musical production of Mary O'Malley's "Once A Catholic" and Sandy Wilson's "The Cheese". After university, while waiting for his broken leg to heal from an amateur football incident he applied for and failed both Civil Service exams, before being asked to apply for MI5 — he failed the second interview. He studied journalism at Cardiff and then worked, at one time, as a sports reporter for the "News of the World". Chiles joined the BBC, originally for work experience on "Business Breakfast". Chiles' experience from "Financial World Tonight" led to him fronting the BBC Two business show "Working Lunch", where he came to popular notice. He has since created, scripted and fronted a variety of other programmes for the BBC, including for BBC Two the 2003 series "So What Do You Do All Day?" a look at the lives of the rich and famous, and "Asian Millionaires". For BBC One he created and fronted "Royal Millions", an investigation of the Queen's finances, as well as reports for "Panorama" and various documentaries. From 2006 until 2009, Chiles presented the spin-off series of the popular UK television show "The Apprentice" called "" in which he interviews the latest candidate to be fired. He left the BBC in 2009, and was replaced by Dara Ó Briain. During August 2006 Chiles co-presented a pilot of a new BBC One early-evening magazine programme, "The One Show". The programme was re-commissioned for 2007 with Chiles returning as host, leaving "Working Lunch". Chiles' last appearance on "The One Show" was on 30 April 2010 and his favourite guest from the programme, rock singer Robert Plant, appeared again. His final show also saw video tributes to an emotional Chiles from Prime Minister Gordon Brown and political leaders David Cameron and Nick Clegg. In April 2007, Chiles was a guest host of BBC One's satirical news quiz, "Have I Got News for You". In January 2016, Chiles returned to BBC television, where he fronted a 2-part religion/travel series "My Mediterranean with Adrian Chiles" for BBC Two. In July 2016, he presented a special edition of "Panorama" called "Why We Voted to Leave: Britain Speaks" for BBC One. In November 2016, he fronted one-off documentary "Whites v Blacks: How Football Changed a Nation" for BBC Two. Chiles co-presented "Christine and Adrian's Friendship Test", a three-part documentary series with Christine Lampard. The series was broadcast on BBC Northern Ireland in November 2017. In August 2018, Chiles presented a BBC Two documentary entitled "Drinkers Like Me" in which he admitted to regularly drinking in excess of 100 units of alcohol per week and investigated why alcohol had become such a big part of his life. As part of the programme, a doctor carried out a Fibroscan liver test on him, which produced a score of 8.9, indicating mild/moderate fibrosis of the liver and significant hepatic steatosis. When the BBC won back the rights to Premier League football, Chiles became the host of "Match of the Day 2" on Sundays. In the run-up to the 2006 World Cup, he was an integral part in BBC Three's African Cup of Nations coverage. He was also a member of the BBC's World Cup team often bringing viewers late night highlights. He was a main presenter of the BBC's Euro 2008 coverage and was one of the anchors of the morning 2008 Olympics coverage from Beijing. After news media speculation suggesting that the BBC wished to increase the popularity of "The One Show" on Fridays by introducing Chris Evans alongside Christine Lampard in an extended one-hour format, Chiles was said to be discussing a contract with ITV. After Evans was confirmed as the new Friday presenter in a revamped one-hour format, Chiles left the BBC for ITV in a four-year contract, speculated to be worth £1million per year. Chiles left the BBC on 30 April 2010. From May 2010, Chiles fronted ITV's football coverage. He made his ITV debut on 24 May 2010, presenting the England v Mexico friendly at Wembley (England won the match 3-1). On 6 September 2010, he made his first appearance on "Daybreak", ITV's new breakfast television programme. The show failed to capture a larger market share than its competitor "Breakfast", and on 18 November 2011 it was announced that Chiles would be axed from the show. He was replaced by Dan Lobb. In January 2011, Chiles began presenting "That Sunday Night Show" on ITV, which returned for a second series in September 2011 and a third in January 2012. His contract with ITV came an end on 20 April 2014. However, he signed a new contract to purely host ITV's football coverage. The new contract included a wage cut of £1 million per year. On 23 January 2015, it was announced that Chiles had left his role as ITV's football host with immediate effect. He has not returned to the channel since. In his early career at the BBC, Chiles became an assistant producer and, by 1993, was presenting Radio 4's "Financial World Tonight". He began presenting and producing his own show "Chiles on Saturday" for Radio 5 Live, which was awarded the sports category Gold Medal at the "Sony Radio Academy Awards" in 2002. In November 2013, Chiles returned to Radio 5 Live, co-presenting "Drive on Fridays" with Anna Foster. In October 2014, he became the Monday and Tuesday host of new programme "5 Live Daily" from 10am – 1pm; with Peter Allen, and subsequently Emma Barnett, hosting Wednesday to Friday. In January 2018, he was moved to Fridays only and the title was changed to "Chiles on Friday", with Emma Barnett hosting from Monday to Thursday under the title "The Emma Barnett Show", although the content remains essentially the same. Chiles is the author of "We Don't Know What We're Doing." Published in 2007, the book recounts the stories of a varied cast of avid West Bromwich Albion supporters whom Chiles met over the course of the 2005–06 season, at the end of which the team was relegated from the Premier League. The book also documents Chiles' own obsession with his beloved "Baggies". He was the World Record holder for highest number of kisses received in 60 seconds from 2007 until 2009, with 78. In 2004, Chiles appeared with Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook in the film "Sex Lives of the Potato Men" in a cameo role as the host of a sex party. He appeared on the second series of "Al Murray's Happy Hour" as himself, and also had a cameo as himself in Series Two of "That Mitchell and Webb Look". On 23 November 2009, Chiles released a "2 Good 2 Bad: The World Cup DVD" based on the popular segment from "Match of the Day 2". Chiles married Jane Garvey, now a regular presenter of "Woman's Hour" on Radio 4, in September 1998 in Swansea. Chiles and Garvey have two daughters. In June 2008, the couple separated; they divorced in October 2009. He is a convert to Roman Catholicism. During Lent 2015, he attended Mass daily and at a different church each time; a total of 46 different churches in 46 days. He is a well known supporter of West Bromwich Albion Football Club, where he is a season-ticket holder and presenter on some of the club's official DVDs. Both of his cars have WBA in their registration and he has a stained glass West Bromwich Albion crest above his door. Chiles plays the double bass, as revealed when he dueted with violinist Nigel Kennedy playing "Fever" on "The One Show." On 7 May 2008 his co-presenter on "The One Show", Christine Lampard, sang part of a song with Chiles accompanying on piano. He claims that his "Brummie" accent worked in his favour at the BBC. In March 2008, Chiles embarked on a charity cycling trip with footballer Alan Shearer from Newcastle upon Tyne to London via West Bromwich for Sport Relief. The duo raised £371,065 for their feat. In 2010, Chiles grew a beard, which was later shaved off by his "One Show" co-host Christine Lampard for Sport Relief, raising £60,000 in the process. </doc> <doc id="2343806" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343806" title="Richard Bond (RNC)"> Richard Bond (RNC) Richard Norman Bond is a former Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC).

It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 46 (or virtual channel 14 via PSIP) from a transmitter in the Wolf Hills section of Henderson, Kentucky. Owned by Raycom Media, the station has studios on Mount Auburn Road in Evansville. On cable, WFIE is available on WOW! and Charter Spectrum channel 4. WFIE was granted a construction permit on June 10, 1953, and began broadcasting on November 15, 1953 on analog UHF channel 62. The station, Indiana's sixth, was originally co-owned by Jesse, Isadore, and Oscar Fine. WFIE was the first station to be based in Evansville proper; WEHT (channel 25), while licensed to Evansville and having launched a month and half before WFIE, has always had their studios located across the Ohio River in Henderson, Kentucky. WFIE was originally a primary NBC outlet with secondary ABC (shared with WEHT) and DuMont affiliations. Both of those networks were dropped in August 1956 with the launch of WTVW (which took ABC) and the shutdown of DuMont. This left WFIE as a full-time NBC affiliate. It is the only station in the market to have never changed its primary affiliation; as such, WFIE has the distinction of being the longest-tenured NBC affiliate in the state of Indiana. Also in 1956, WFIE became the area's first station to telecast color programming (by virtue of its NBC affiliation). The Fine family sold the station to the George Norton family of Louisville, Kentucky (owners of fellow NBC affiliate WAVE-TV) in 1956. The Nortons' broadcasting holdings would eventually become known as Orion Broadcasting. With FCC approval, it moved to channel 14 in August 1961. It was the first station in Evansville to telecast live and local color programs beginning on March 10, 1966. In October 1981, Orion merged with Cosmos Broadcasting Corporation, a subsidiary of insurance and broadcasting conglomerate Liberty Corporation. WFIE became the first television station in the market to broadcast in stereo in September 1985. Liberty bowed out of the insurance business in 2000 bringing WFIE directly under the company banner. In May 2002, the station began broadcasting digitally on channel 46. On February 1, 2006, Liberty Corporation merged with Raycom Media, with ownership remaining steady for over 12 years. On June 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Gray Television announced it had reached an agreement with Raycom to merge their respective broadcasting assets (consisting of Raycom's 63 existing owned-and/or-operated television stations, including WFIE), and Gray's 93 television stations) under the former's corporate umbrella. The cash-and-stock merger transaction valued at $3.6 billion – in which Gray shareholders would acquire preferred stock currently held by Raycom – will result in WFIE gaining new sister stations in nearby markets, including fellow NBC affiliate WNDU in South Bend (currently Gray's only Indiana station) and ABC/Fox affiliate WBKO in adjacent Bowling Green, Kentucky, in addition to its current Raycom sister stations. 14.2 launched in 2006 as a locally-originated automated feed of weather conditions from the station's weather computers known as "14Xtra". In November 2006, WFIE added music video network The Tube on digital channel 14.3 along with many other Raycom Media stations. It was regarded as a failure, and the network ended operations on October 31, 2007, along with 14.3 going dark until February 4, 2009, when it was relaunched as the market's This affiliate. On November 1, 2013, Raycom's contract with This ended and it began to carry Movies! until October 28, 2014, when it took over the MeTV affiliation from WTSN-CD (channel 20), which replaced 14Xtra 14.2, with 14.3 becoming an early affiliate of Grit. WFIE-DT2 currently carries ACC Network programming, including college basketball and football games. The station's digital signal is multiplexed: WFIE discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 14, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 46, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 14. Syndicated programming on WFIE includes "Jeopardy!", "Wheel of Fortune", "Crime Watch Daily", and "Right This Minute". The station currently carries 32 hours of local newscasts per week (with six hours on weekdays, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); in addition, the station produces a half-hour weeknight-only newscast for its second digital subchannel, bringing the total amount to 34½ hours per week. As a result of the merger of the news operations of WTVW and WEHT on December 1, 2011, WFIE and CBS affiliate WEVV-TV are now the only independent local news operations in the Evansville market. In August 1977, the station became first in Evansville to remotely broadcast local news, sports, and weather outside its studios. It was the second station in Indiana (first in Evansville) to build its own Doppler weather radar system (located adjacent to the studios) in February 1988. In Fall 2005, it launched a 24-hour local weather channel on digital channel 14.2. Known as "First Alert Weather Now", it was part of NBC Weather Plus and featured continuous weather and news information, with local and national forecasts, as well as metro Evansville and regional traffic updates. With the shutdown of the national service in 2008, WFIE-DT2 remained as a local weather channel until October 28, 2014. On April 3, 2006, WFIE abandoned 615 Music's popular "News One" theme music in favor of "NBC Flagship" as part of "The NBC Collection" by Gari Communications. This marked the station's first theme change since 1996. In early-August 2006, it began branding its newscasts as "14 News" dropping the "NewsWatch 14" identity. In a further transition, the station rebranded the weather department under the "First Alert" label on September 22, 2006. This is a departure from the "Storm Team" brand used since the mid-1990s. On April 16, 2007, WFIE introduced "Dual Doppler" to the market with the debut of a second weather radar in Owensboro, Kentucky atop the Owensboro Medical Health System Hospital main building on East Parrish Avenue (KY 54). In addition to its main studios, the station operates Western Kentucky Newsrooms in Owensboro and Madisonville. It is the only channel in the area to have a weekday morning show that begins at 4:30. WFIE-DT2 also airs a prime time newscast weeknights at 9 p.m., which competes with an hour-long show on CW affiliate WTVW. On July 11, 2011, WFIE began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition during the station's 5 p.m. newscast, becoming the first station in the Evansville market to begin offering local newscasts in high definition. On September 12, 2011, WFIE debuted a 4 p.m. newscast that competes against the 4 p.m. newscast on ABC affiliate WEHT; Jackie Monroe (currently the anchor of the station's 10 p.m. newscast and the 9 p.m. newscast seen on digital channel 14.2) serves as anchor of the new late-afternoon newscast, which lasted until 2013. WFIE maintains a "sister-station" relationship with a television station in the western Ukraine city of Ternopil. </doc> <doc id="2343811" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343811" title="Temperature measurement"> Temperature measurement Temperature measurement, also known as thermometry, describes the process of measuring a current local temperature for immediate or later evaluation. Datasets consisting of repeated standardized measurements can be used to assess temperature trends. Attempts at standardized temperature measurement prior to the 17th century were crude at best. For instance in 170 AD, physician Claudius Galenus mixed equal portions of ice and boiling water to create a "neutral" temperature standard. The modern scientific field has its origins in the works by Florentine scientists in the 1600s including Galileo constructing devices able to measure relative change in temperature, but subject also to confounding with atmospheric pressure changes. These early devices were called thermoscopes. The first sealed thermometer was constructed in 1641 by the Grand Duke of Toscani, Ferdinand II. The development of today's thermometers and temperature scales began in the early 18th century, when Gabriel Fahrenheit produced a mercury thermometer and scale, both developed by Ole Christensen Rømer. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use, alongside the Celsius and Kelvin scales. Many methods have been developed for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the gas thermometer. Other important devices for measuring temperature include: One must be careful when measuring temperature to ensure that the measuring instrument (thermometer, thermocouple, etc.) is really the same temperature as the material that is being measured. Under some conditions heat from the measuring instrument can cause a temperature gradient, so the measured temperature is different from the actual temperature of the system. In such a case the measured temperature will vary not only with the temperature of the system, but also with the heat transfer properties of the system. What thermal comfort humans, animals and plants experience is related to more than temperature shown on a glass thermometer. Relative humidity levels in ambient air can induce more or less evaporative cooling. Measurement of the wet-bulb temperature normalizes this humidity effect. Mean radiant temperature also can affect thermal comfort. The wind chill factor makes the weather feel colder under windy conditions than calm conditions even though a glass thermometer shows the same temperature. Airflow increases the rate of heat transfer from or to the body, resulting in a larger change in body temperature for the same ambient temperature. The theoretical basis for thermometers is the zeroth law of thermodynamics which postulates that if you have three bodies, A, B and C, if A and B are at the same temperature, and B and C are at the same temperature then A and C are at the same temperature. B, of course, is the thermometer. The practical basis of thermometry is the existence of triple point cells. Triple points are conditions of pressure, volume and temperature such that three phases are simultaneously present, for example solid, vapor and liquid. For a single component there are no degrees of freedom at a triple point and any change in the three variables results in one or more of the phases vanishing from the cell. Therefore, triple point cells can be used as universal references for temperature and pressure (see Gibbs phase rule). Under some conditions it becomes possible to measure temperature by a direct use of the Planck's law of black-body radiation. For example, the cosmic microwave background temperature has been measured from the spectrum of photons observed by satellite observations such as the WMAP. In the study of the quark–gluon plasma through heavy-ion collisions, single particle spectra sometimes serve as a thermometer. During recent decades, many thermometric techniques have been developed. The most promising and widespread non-invasive thermometric techniques are based on the analysis of magnetic resonance images, computerised tomography images and echotomography images. These techniques allow monitoring temperature within tissues without introducing a sensing element. The temperature of the air near the surface of the Earth is measured at meteorological observatories and weather stations, usually using thermometers placed in a shelter such as Stevenson screen, a standardized well-ventilated white-painted instrument shelter. The thermometers should be positioned 1.25–2 m above the ground. Details of this setup are defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). A true daily mean could be obtained from a continuously-recording thermograph. Commonly it is approximated by the mean of discrete readings (e.g. 24 hourly readings, four 6-hourly readings, etc.) or by the mean of the daily minimum and maximum readings (though the latter can result in mean temperatures up to 1 °C cooler or warmer than the true mean, depending on the time of observation). The world's average surface air temperature is about 14 °C. For information on temperature changes relevant to climate change or Earth's geologic past see: Temperature record. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has developed two separate and distinct standards on temperature Measurement, B40.200 and PTC 19.3. B40.200 provides guidelines for bimetallic-actuated, filled-system, and liquid-in-glass thermometers. It also provides guidelines for thermowells. PTC 19.3 provides guidelines for temperature measurement related to Performance Test Codes with particular emphasis on basic sources of measurement errors and techniques for coping with them. </doc> <doc id="2343815" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343815" title="Nilima Ibrahim"> Nilima Ibrahim Nilima Ibrahim (11 October 1921 – 18 June 2002) was a Bangladeshi educationist, littérateur and social worker. She is well known for her scholarship on Bengali literature but even more so for her depiction of raped and tortured women in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War in her book "Ami Birangona Bolchhi" ("I, the heroine, speaks"). She was awarded Bangla Academy Literary Award in 1969, Begum Rokeya Padak (1996) and Ekushey Padak in 2000 by the Government of Bangladesh for her contributions to Bangla literature. Ibrahim was born on 11 January 1921 in Bagerhat, Khulna to Zamindar Prafulla Roy Chowdhury and Kusum Kumari Devi. Ibrahim passed her school leaving examination and entrance level examinations from the Khulna Coronation Girls' School in 1937 and from the Victoria Institution in Calcutta in 1939. Later she earned bachelor's degrees in arts and teaching from the Scottish Church College, which was followed by an MA in Bengali literature from the University of Calcutta in 1943. She would also earn a doctorate in Bengali literature from the University of Dhaka in 1959. Ibrahim was a career academic. She taught in respectively the Khulna Coronation Girls' School, Loreto House, the Victoria Institution, and finally at the University of Dhaka, where she was appointed as a lecturer in 1956, and as a professor of Bengali in 1972. She also served as the chairperson of the Bangla Academy, and as the Vice Chairperson of the World Women's Federation's South Asian Zone. </doc> <doc id="2343819" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343819" title="Ben Weisman"> Ben Weisman Ben Weisman (November 16, 1921 – May 20, 2007) was an American composer significant for having written more songs recorded by Elvis Presley (fifty seven) than any other songwriter in history. The Mad Professor as Weisman was nicknamed by Elvis, worked with the King from 1956 ("First in Line") to 1971 ("Change of Habit"). Their early association (1957–62) produced many of the most powerful rockers and poignant ballads in Presley's repertoire, including "Got a Lot o' Livin' to Do", "Follow That Dream", "Rock-A-Hula Baby", "Crawfish", "As Long as I Have You", "Pocketful of Rainbows" and "Fame and Fortune". In recent years, covers and remixes of Weisman classics have been worldwide hits once again. Weisman's "Got A Lot 'O Livin' To Do" is featured in Cirque du Soleil's "Viva Elvis" live show and upcoming 3-D motion picture. Weisman's compositions continue to be re-interpreted with vigor and imagination by such iconic contemporary artists as Tom Petty, Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Johnny Cash, The Cramps, Nick Cave, Junior Brown, the Yellow Magic Orchestra, k.d. lang, The Pogues, Johnny Thunders and The Blackeyed Susans. Since Weisman's outward appearance was atypical for a "rock 'n' roll guy", Elvis' nickname for him was "the mad professor." All within ear shot also understood that Elvis was playing off the fact that Weisman was a "mad professor" of music and composition. Weisman's recorded compositions number nearly 400 songs and his published songs exceed 1000 titles. Weisman's songs have sold over 100 million album units. These songs have been recorded by many musical legends including, The Beatles, Dean Martin, Barbra Streisand, Sarah Vaughan, Ernest Tubb, Peggy Lee, Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole, Conway Twitty, Dusty Springfield, Bobby Vee, Woody Herman, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, Carl Perkins, Herman and the Hermits, The Carpenters, Billy Eckstein, The Statler Brothers, Reba McEntire, Hank Snow, The Moonglows, Cass Elliot, Vic Damone, Lionel Hampton, and Dionne Warwick. At Weisman's last social gathering with "The King", Elvis proudly announced to the crowd that he had recorded more of Ben's songs than those of any other songwriter. Weisman quote, "Elvis invited me to come to one of those wild parties, you know, the last evening of the season in crazy Vegas. I went upstairs and Elvis grabbed me, stood me up in front of the crowd and announced, "I want you all to meet Ben Weisman. The man who has written more songs for me than any other writer - 57! I want to hear it for this man". " There was a big applause, then he took me over to the piano. It was just me and him. Elvis wasn't looking too good. His eyes were puffy and he'd gotten very, very heavy. He said to me, 'Ben, there's a song I love called "Softly As I Leave You".'" Indeed, I knew it well, one of those ballads that just about everyone had a crack at in the sixties." "After he sang his heart out Elvis said, 'This is not a song about a man who's leaving his girlfriend. It's a song about a man who is going to die.' I didn't know what to say, but I knew there was trouble coming. As Elvis held my arm, I could feel his hand shaking. It made me feel as though mine was shaking, too. And that was the last time I saw him." After Presley's death Weisman composed the symphonic tribute, "The Elvis Concerto," to honor the musical partner whom he shared so many artistic achievements that were also commercial successes. After performing a worldwide tour of the concerto, Weisman, with Elvis gone, retired from public life and wrote very little music thereafter. 'I approached writing for Elvis differently than I did for any other artist. Elvis challenged my imagination. The songs had to have a combination of blues, country, rock and pop, sometimes gospel or swamp boogie, you name it. I lived my creative life walking in his musical shoes. And what shoes they were! Elvis had so much spirit. Beyond compare really. Elvis was a transformer, a rebel, like a meteorite, someone who only comes along once every few hundred years. He had that level of magnetism. Astonishing to be a part of it! And to write for him, to try and express what I knew he was going through as a man, throughout that whole journey. I feel very lucky.' Ben Weisman, "the mad professor," died in 2007 in Los Angeles, California, surrounded by friends and family. </doc> <doc id="2343825" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343825" title="Robert Ferrar"> Robert Ferrar Robert Ferrar (died 30 March 1555) was a Bishop of St David's in Wales. He was prior of Nostell Priory, embraced the English Reformation, and was made Bishop of St. David's by Edward VI. He suffered martyrdom during the Marian persecutions. There is no specific information on the date and place of Robert Ferrar's birth, but he did state to Stephen Gardiner that he was born in the reign of King Henry VII. It is assumed he was born in Yorkshire because of his later connections with the county: He was found first living at Nostell Priory in Yorkshire in the 1520s. On 24 May 1524, Ferrar was ordained successively as acolyte and subdeacon. On 24 September, four months later, he was ordained as deacon. After being ordained as a deacon all students participated in a profession, a promise to lead a life of poverty, chastity and obedience. Ferrar argued that to live chastely entailed a life of celibacy. From among the canons of Nostell he was chosen to receive the benefit of a university education sponsored by the priory. From c.1525–1534 Ferrar was a student at the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford, where he became a Bachelor of Theology. In 1526, while Ferrar was in Cambridge, a number of students took an interest in the teachings of Martin Luther, and were later to become prominent as reformers and martyrs of the English church. These included Thomas Cranmer, Hugh Latimer, Thomas Bilney and Robert Barnes. They were bold enough to preach new doctrines publicly, but were accused of heresy and forced to conform with the traditional teaching. Also in 1528 the prior of St. Mary's college at Oxford was John Ramsey. Among his books was a copy of Erasmus's "Enchiridion militis Christiani" or "Handbook of the Christian Soldier." A group of scholars of New Cardinal College spread the teachings of the reformer among Oxford students. Because Lutheranism was suspected within the college, a purge and search was ordered, and illegal reformist books were found. Ferrar was on John Foxe's list as possessing forbidden books, leading to his first arrest. Ferrar formally applied for his degree in theology in May 1533, which was granted. After receiving his licence, Ferrar preached in the towns and villages near Nostell Priory where he was based. In June 1538 Thomas Cromwell appointed Ferrar as Prior of St. Oswald. Ferrar left the priorship by 1539 and there is little record of him for the next seven years. According to sources, he did not preach during this time. When Henry VIII passed the Act of Six Articles Ferrar was a target for attack by those who sought to enforce it. He was summoned on 10 September 1540 for the safety of his soul and heretical views. When he failed to appear he was excommunicated. He bought land in 1545 for agricultural and business purposes. In 1547 Edward VI took the throne, and Ferrar was released from prison following the repeal of the Six Articles. He was then appointed as a preacher to represent Edward during the royal visitation of 1547. Ferrar worked to bring reforms, such as the addition of the English Bible, the exposure of idolatry and other "superstitious" activities, throughout several dioceses in England and Wales. Soon after, Ferrar was appointed as the Bishop of St. David's diocese by Edward VI on Sunday 9 September 1548. It is unclear why, but several months passed between Ferrar's consecration and his arrival at St. David's. Upon his arrival, however, he moved for serious reforms. Ferrar pursued religious reform in his short term as bishop through parliamentary legislation, administration of ecclesiastical property, control over the cathedral chapter, supervision of clergy, enforcing discipline through court, and direct approaches to the congregation through biblical preaching. This radical restructuring led to conflict between him and his clergy, particularly Rowland Meyrick, appointed in 1550 as chancellor. A "blame game" ensued between them: Ferrar accused them of accepting bribes while his clergy claimed "praemunire". This would eventually lead to his downfall when his clergy stood witness against Ferrar. Formal trouble arose for Ferrar when his canons at St. David's put together an indictment against him with 56 articles. The accusations against him were under the categories of: Under the first category, it was alleged that when he first became bishop, he "appointed his chancellor by his letter of commission," ignoring the king's style and authority. In the second place, he was accused because he didn't rebuke people who prayed with beads in their hands when he met with them, knowing that it was superstitious. He was also accused of not speaking about enough godly things; instead it was said that he spoke of worldly things such as: "baking, brewing," In addition, under category four he was accused that his church service wasn't paraphrased in English, and some of his churches did not have English bibles. Ferrar responded twice to the charges made against him at Carmarthen. "Foxe's Book of Martyrs" contains a response, by an unknown writer, to the accusations made against Ferrar in 1551. This response is written in the style of a legal document, and was likely presented in 1552. An excerpt from this document reads, The said bishop allegeth that he hath not ... used any superstitions of papistry, as it is untruly surmised against him; but hath and doth, to the uttermost of his power, wit, and cunning, set forth, preach, and teach, the true doctrine of the Gospel." The articles presented against Ferrar in 1551 were inconclusive, so the Privy Council requested an examination of witnesses. It took place from 3 May to 7 May 1552. Ferrar was kept in London while the witnesses were being interviewed, so he would not affect how people answered the questions. Around 124 witnesses were interviewed. The witness examinations were supposed to take place before three commissioners: Thomas Jones, John Wogan, and David Vaughan. Because so many witnesses were interviewed, over such a short period of time, the process of the commission was suspect. In November 1552, Ferrar was able to present objections concerning witness testimony. Ferrar believed that certain witnesses were biased, because they were people who had shown hostility towards him in the past. Witnesses who may have been biased in their accusations against Ferrar included Roger Barlow, Griffith Dwnn, Thomas John Thomas, and John Evans. About half the witnesses' testimony concerned how Ferrar was aware of the crimes committed by his officers and friends, but failed to punish them. Brown sees this as "a concerted attempt to blacken Ferrar's name through attacking the character of his supporters." On the other hand, there were witnesses who denied the charges made against Ferrar. Roger Owen, a commissary of Ferrar, denied a few of the 56 articles. Ferrar was sent to King's Bench Prison in Southwark when Queen Mary took the throne in 1553. He was imprisoned with other bishops, including John Hooper of Gloucester and Miles Coverdale of Exeter. On 14 February 1554 Bishop Gardiner charged Ferrar with violation of chastity. "He was required to answer whether he believed in the lawfulness of clerical matrimony and in transubstantiation. For some time Ferrar refused to answer. At another sitting Bishop Morgan pronounced him contumacious, and condemned him." In March 1554, Ferrar officially lost his position as a bishop. Ferrar's desire was to die as a "true bearer of the cross of Christ". His martyrdom took place on 30 March 1555 on the market square (now Nott's Square) in Carmarthen. He received this secular execution publicly as an example to any who were wishing to conform to his doctrines which were deemed inadequate and brought many accusations upon him. On 30 March he was burnt on the south side of the market cross, telling (a spectator) that "if he saw him once stir in the pains of his burning, he might then give no credit to his doctrine; and as he said, so did he maintain his promise, patiently standing without emotion, until one Richard Gravell with a staff struck him down." Ferrar's death is the subject of a 1970 poem called "The Martyrdom of Bishop Farrar" ("sic") by the poet Ted Hughes. "Ted Hughes was related to Ferrar on his mother's side; the stoical gene helped him get through his own years of trial and persecution." Ferrar's son, Samuel, obtained preferment in the Diocese of St. David's. His daughter married Lewis Williams, rector of Narberth. -1485-1509: Ferrar is born sometime under the reign of Henry VII -1520s: Ferrar lives in St. Oswald's monastery -24 May 1524: Ordained acolyte and subdeacon at St. Oswald's -25 September 1524: Ordained as deacon at St. Oswald's -1525-1534: Studies at Cambridge and Oxford, acquiring a bachelor's degree in theology -1538-1539: Prior of St. Oswald's -1540: Ferrar is summoned for heresy under The Six Articles Act -1547: Edward VI takes rule after Henry VIII dies; Ferrar is appointed preacher to represent Edward during the royal visitation of 1547 to spread reforms -Sometime in 1548: Ferrar is married to his wife, Elizabeth -9 September 1548: Ferrar is consecrated as Bishop of St. David's, having been appointed by Edward VI -24 November 1548 – 14 March 1549: Ferrar attends the House of Lords and plays a role in the passing of the Uniformity Act, instituting mandatory English prayer books -1549: spends time travelling throughout his diocese preaching and spreading reforms under Edward VI -1550: Birth of his first son, Samuel -1551: Birth of second son, Griffith -Autumn 1551: 56 articles presented to Privy Council -1552: Statements are made on Ferrar's behalf that he "preached and taught the true doctrine of the Gospel" -May 1552: Commission of Witnesses interviewed -November 1552: Ferrar presents objections to witness testimony -1553: Queen Mary takes throne and Ferrar is sent to Bench Prison in Southwark -1553: Birth of third son, Sage -February 1554: Bishop Gardiner charges Ferrar with violation of chastity -March 1554: Ferrar officially loses his position of bishop -13 March 1555: Ferrar is sentenced to death for his crimes -30 March 1555: Ferrar is burned at the stake in Carmarthen </doc> <doc id="2343829" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343829" title="Cham issue"> Cham issue The Cham issue refers to a controversy which has been raised by Albania since the 1990s over the repatriation of the Cham Albanians, who were expelled from the Greek region of Epirus between 1944 and 1945, at the end of World War II, citing the collaboration of the majority of them with the occupying forces of the Axis powers. While Albania presses for the issue to be re-opened, Greece considers the matter closed. However, it was agreed to create a bilateral commission, only about the property issue, as a technical problem. The commission was set up in 1999, but has not yet functioned. In the late Ottoman period, tensions between the Muslim Chams and the local Greek Orthodox Christian population emerged through communal conflicts that continued during the Balkan Wars, when part of the historic region of Epirus, including the area of Chameria, became part of Greece. During the First Balkan War, a majority of Cham Albanians, though at first reluctant, sided with the Ottoman forces against the Greek forces and formed irregular armed units and burned Christian Orthodox-inhabited settlements, with only few Albanian beys willing to accept Greek rule in the region. As a response to this activity Greek guerilla units were organized in the region. After the Balkan wars and during the interwar period, the Muslim Chams were not integrated into the Greek state and faced discrimination, and were counted for the 1923 Population exchange between Greece and Turkey, and some of them were transferred to Turkey, while their property was alienated by the Greek government, as part of the Treaty of Lausanne. Moreover, the Orthodox Cham Albanians were counted as Greeks, and their language and heritage were under pressure of assimilation. During the interwar period, Italy's fascist regime initiated an aggressive pro-Albanian propaganda and cultivated the Albanian irredentism by promising expansion of Albania towards Chameria in Greece as part of the creation of a Greater Albanian state and mobilized ethnic Albanians in tactical army units and fascist militia inside Albania, and groups of spies, saboteurs and irregulars in Greece. The latter had orders from Galeazzo Ciano to cause unrest in Chameria, while Italy was preparing for Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 from Albania, then a protectorate of Italy. In August 1940 the killing, possibly by Greek police, of an Albanian possibly acting as saboteur, was used by Italy as a pretext to worsen relations with Greece and as a tool of propaganda in Albania. When Italy begun the invasion in Greece on 28 October 1940, there were at least two battalions of Albanian fascist militia acting against the local Greeks in the Korca area. Italy's Prime Minister, Benito Mussolini claimed publicly that two Albanian battalions were attached to each Italian division that invaded Greece. During the German-Italian occupation of Greece (1941–1944), the Italians gained control of Greek Epirus and attempted to annex it to Albania but Germans did not allow it. However, a small portion of Epirus came under the administration of Tirana, known as "Këshilla". At the end of World War II, nearly all Muslim Chams in Greece were expelled to Albania due to collaboration with the Axis and decided to join the Greek resistance only after the summer of 1944, when it was clear that the Nazi Germans were withdrawing. In January 1991, as the Communist Party of Albania was disintegrating, the Chameria National Political Association was founded as a political lobby to "express and defend" the interests of the people of Chameria. The main issue that Muslim Cham Albanians demand is the restoration of the Greek citizenship, whilst retaining the citizenship of the country in which they currently reside and the recognition of a minority status. The restoration of their properties is another main issue, while some would not accept only financial compensation. According to most Chams, money is not as important as citizenship. They request the peaceful solution of the Cham issue, on the following cases: The controversial Cham issue has lain dormant in recent years and none of the post-war Albanian governments, whether communist, democratic or socialist, have ventured to try to make it a key issue in relations with Greece. Protests held by Cham organizations were ignored in Albania by both major parties, both the Democratic and the Socialist party. This is seen by some analysts as an attempt to strengthen the negotiating power of the Albanian government by non-raising the Cham Issue, while it could legitimately claim that it was obliged to raise the Cham question because of such strong pressure from the Cham community. The major "Cham march" of 2006, also strengthened the position of the Albanian government because it provided additional arguments in the controversy over the graves of Greek soldiers on Albanian territory. The Albanian government used as a justification the fact that Greece did not allow Chams to pay homage at the graves of their forefathers, while they were asking to build several cemeteries for its soldiers killed in Albania during the Second World War. Although the Albanian government has avoided addressing the Cham issue, prominent Albanian individuals such as former President Rexhep Meidani and Sabri Godo have raised the subject publicly on a number of occasions. The Cham issue was risen during a visit to Athens of former Albanian Prime Minister Ilir Meta at the end of 1999, during his meeting with Greek Prime Minister, Kostas Simitis, but it received a negative response. On December 10, 2012, Shpëtim Idrizi and Dashamir Tahiri, two members of the Albanian Parliament from the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity, presented to the other MP's a resolution where PDIU asked from Greece reparations in the amount of 10 Billion Euros for the Expulsion of Cham Albanians. The Greek government considers the Cham Issue as a closed chapter. According to the Greek official position Cham Albanians will not be allowed to return in Greece "because they have collaborated with the Italian-German invaders during the Second World War, and as such they are war criminals and are punished according to Greek laws". In an attempt to give a solution in 1992 Prime minister Konstantinos Mitsotakis proposed a trade-off in relation to their properties, saying that only in cases: This proposal, however, did not reach any results. When the former Albanian Prime-Minister, Ilir Meta rose this issue to his counterpart, Kostas Simitis, the later considered it as a declaration for home consumption to Albanian journalists covering his visit. Simitis confirmed that Albania expected the Greek government to solve the issue of Cham properties according to the European conventions by which Greece abides. The approval of the Cham resolution by the Albanian Parliament was seen by the Greek ambassador in Tirana as "a non-friendly act by Albania.” The leader of the Greek Minority Party in Albania, Vangjel Duke, meanwhile declared that "this resolution comes at a time when the Balkan region is witnessing intensive events and a period of fragile balances, and the approval of such a resolution would damage those balances that could result in a high political cost for Albania’s foreign policy." The Cham Issue has not been in the agenda of international organizations. Delegates of the Cham community have started since 1991, an attempt to internationalize the Cham Issue, while the only official support for this issue, has come from Turkey. Meanwhile, in 2006, Members of the European Parliament backed the issue and proposed a resolution, which was not put into vote. The only major attempt to internationalize the Cham Issue was in 2005, when representatives from the Cham community in Albania met with members of the European parliament in Strasbourg. European MEP, Doris Pack, Chairperson of the European Parliamentary Delegation for South-Eastern Europe was presented with a dossier about the Cham issue and promised to investigate the possibility for the Chams to visit their homeland and their family graves in Greece, as well as the issue will be discussed with Albania and Greek European MEPs. Other Members of the European parliament promised to look at the possibility of proposing a Parliamentary Resolution which would seek to open a dialogue between Athens and Tirana, with the representation of Chams and international mediators. Turkey, meanwhile, is finding the Cham dispute a useful tool with which to draw international attention to the situation of the Muslim minority in western Thrace. Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Greece for genocide onto Muslim Albanians. Turkey asked Greece to acknowledge the Albanian nationality of Albanian-speaking Orthodox Christians in the same area, to compensate the displaced Chams for the property they have lost, to provide an Albanian Orthodox Church for Albanian Christians, to repatriate the Cham minority and to provide them with Greek citizenship. The main part of the Cham issue is the regaining of the Greek citizenship, by Cham Albanians. As Greece does not acknowledge the Cham issue, as an existent problem between Athens and Tirana, the returning of the citizenship has not been discussed at all. Cham Albanians were Greek citizens of Albanian ethnicity, since 1913 when they chose the Greek nationality and not the Turkish one. When they were expelled, in 1944, the citizenship of 1,930 Cham Albanians was removed after they were sentenced to death as collaborators. The rest, which formed the majority lost their citizenship, under a special law of 1947. Orthodox Chams remained in Greece and retained the Greek citizenship, but without any minority rights. The evicts were organized as refugees in Albania, under the authority of the "National Anti-Fascist Cham Committee", until 1953. At that year the Albanian government disbanded the committee and granted forcefully the Albanian citizenship to the Chams. In Turkey and the United States, Cham Albanians got Turkish and American citizenship respectively. Cham Albanians claim the returning of the Greek citizenship, as a first phase in order to resolve the Cham issue. They are reported not to have as a primary issue the regaining of the properties, but the citizenship, because this is seen by Chams as an excuse for their suffering. They argue that the remove of their citizenship was a collective punishment, when even the Greek courts have charged only a minority of Chams for alleged crimes. They have asked the Greek government to have a dual citizenship, a policy followed by Greece in the case of the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, Greece says that the Cham issue is a closed chapter in the relations between Greece and Albania, and as such, does not accept this claim. The Alienation of Muslim Chams property did not start at the end of World War II when they were expelled. There were four different laws, from 1923 to 1937, that alienated the properties of the Muslim Cham Albanians, as a stipulation of the Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations. Respectively, the immobile property of Greeks evacuating Asia Minor was allienated by Turkey and given to Muslims from Greece. However, the Greek refugees who came from Asia Minor were three times more than the Muslim refugees who left Greece. Following these events, the Greek policy was that properties belonging to either Muslim citizens in Greece, who were exempt from the exchange of populations, or to foreign citizens to be taken. The first law was passed on 15 February 1923, which alienated the lands and second homes of Muslim Cham Albanians, in order to give it to Greek settlers for Asia Minor and to Greek farmers, that had no land. After this law, Muslim Cham Albanians tried to regain their properties, under the Greek Law of 1926, which gave them the opportunity to bring to courts this confiscation. Under these circumstances, Greece passed two laws, in 1930 and 1931, which gave bigger compensations to the Muslim community. But, both of them were executed very limited, because of the change of the Greek government. The final law that nationalized the whole properties of Muslim Cham Albanians and other Albanian nationals in Greece was passed in 1937. This law confiscated all properties of Albanians in Greece and the compensation that it provided were delayed, something which was seen as a provocation. After World War II, Cham Albanian's properties were put under escrow by the Greek state. In 1953, the Greek parliament passed a law, that considered as "abandoned" the rural immovable properties, whose owner had left Greece without permission or passport. After three years the properties were nationalized. While homes were nationalized in 1959, when a law passed by the Greek parliament considered them abandoned and allowed their conquest by other inhabitants of the region. These two laws nationalized Chams properties, and allowed others to settle in their homes, but the ownership was under the Greek state. Under these laws, a number of other inhabitants of Epirus settled in Chameria, especially, Vlachs. The homes and properties of Chams came under their administration, but the new inhabitants did not have neither the legal ownership, nor the right to sell or buy other properties of Chams. In the decades of '60s and '70s an ad hoc commission for the property alienation in Thesprotia gave by draw the rural properties to farmers with and without land, while homes and urban properties in Igoumenitsa, Paramithia, Margariti, Filiates, Perdika and Sybota were given to homeless people. Cham representatives in Albania ask for the return of the community in Greece and minority rights. They also request that a minority status should accepted for the Orthodox Albanian speakers that remained in Greece. Some Albanian politicians tend to support such positions, thus in January 2000, Sali Berisha, then head of the opposition demanded more rights for the Cham minority in Greece, which includes cultural rights for Albanians living in Greece: opening of an Albanian-language school in the town of Filiates, among others. In 2005, a diplomatic incident occurred, when the President of Greece, Karolos Papoulias canceled his planned-meeting with Albanian homologue, Alfred Moisiu, in Saranda, because 200 Cham Albanians, were demonstrating for the Cham Issue. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the Albanian authorities did not take adequate measures in order to protect the Greek President "by deterring known extremist elements, who are trying to hinder the smooth development of Greek-Albanian relations". Albanian president's office stated that President Moisiu expressed deep sorrow at this unexplainable decision, which was based upon misinformation, of the "small, peaceful and well monitored demonstration". On 29 September 2016 the Enlargement Commissioner of the European Union Johannes Hahn mentioned the Cham issue as an existing unresolved issue between Albania and Greece, alongside other matters that the two countries needed to resolve. This statement was opposed and criticized by the Greek Foreign Minister, Nikos Kotzias, who asked the Commissioner to withdraw and correct his declaration, in what can be considered as one of his harshest tones, with a direct and threatening speech. Meanwhile, on the Albanian Parliament this statement of the Commissioner was greeted by some MP's, including Shpëtim Idrizi, leader of the Party for Justice, Integration and Unity, whose primary aim is the promotion of the cham issues and also by the Foreign Minister of Albania Ditmir Bushati. It was later revealed by the local media that Hahn's statement on the Cham issue was influenced by Romana Vlahuttin, the EU's Ambassador to Tirana who was allegedly involved in economic and corruption scandals in Albania. Liberation Army of Chameria () is a reported paramilitary formation in the northern Greek region of Epirus. The organisation is reportedly linked to the Kosovo Liberation Army and the National Liberation Army, both ethnic Albanian paramilitary organisations in Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia respectively. In 2001 the Greek police reported that the group consisted of approximately 30-40 Albanians. It has not the official support of the Albanian government. </doc> <doc id="2343832" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343832" title="Joan Chittister"> Joan Chittister Sister Joan D. Chittister, (born April 26, 1936) is an American Benedictine nun, theologian, author, and speaker.

Chittister was born April 26, 1936 to Daniel and Loretta Daugherty. Her father died when she was very young and her mother married Harold Chittister, whom Joan Chittister describes as an abusive alcoholic, although she remained sufficiently attached to him that as an adult she chose to retain his surname. She was taught by the Sisters of St. Joseph, and later attended Benedictine Academy in Erie, Pennsylvania. Shortly after joining the Benedictine community, Chittister contracted polio. Chittister holds a master's degree from the University of Notre Dame and a Ph.D. in speech communication theory from Penn State University. She was also a research associate of St. Edmund's College, Cambridge University.

She was queen of Naples during the reign of her spouse there, and regent of Naples during his absence four times: in 1812-13, 1813, 1814 and 1815. Caroline was born in Ajaccio, Corsica. She was a younger sister of Joseph Bonaparte, Napoléon Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte, Elisa Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte and Pauline Bonaparte. She was an older sister of Jérôme Bonaparte. In 1793, Caroline moved with her family to France during the French Revolution. Caroline was educated as a pupil at the school in St-Germain-en-Laye founded by Madame Jeanne Campan. She attended the school at the same time as Hortense, Joséphine's daughter and Caroline's brother Louis' wife. She fell in love with Joachim Murat, one of her brother's generals, and they married on 20 January 1800. Caroline was seventeen years old. Initially, Napoleon did not wish to allow them to marry, however, his wife Joséphine de Beauharnais persuaded him to change his mind. When Napoleon became Emperor, she and her sisters successfully asked to be made Imperial princesses. Caroline became Grand Duchess of Berg and Cleves on 15 March 1806 and Queen consort of Naples on 1 August 1808, when her husband was appointed to the equivalent positions by her brother. According to the terms of the appointment, she would keep the title queen also after the death of her spouse. As queen, Caroline renovated the royal residences in Naples, had new gardens planned, encouraged the growing interest in furniture of Classical design, patronized the silk- and cotton industry and French artists in Naples, showed an interest in the archaeological discoveries of Pompeii and founded a school for girls. She was described as intensely jealous of her sister-in-law Joséphine and her children, reportedly because she felt Napoleon favored them over his Bonaparte relatives. It was reportedly Caroline who arranged for Napoleon to take a mistress, Éléonore Denuelle, who duly gave birth to his first illegitimate child. This had the desired effect of establishing that Joséphine was infertile, as Napoleon showed he was clearly capable of siring children, which eventually resulted in his divorce from Josephine and remarriage. In 1810, when Napoleon married his second Empress Consort Marie Louise of Austria, Caroline was responsible for escorting her to France. After meeting her at the border of Austria and her duchy, Caroline forced Marie-Louise to leave all her luggage, servants, and even her pet dog, behind in Austria. Caroline devoted herself to the interests of her husband Joachim Murat, the King of Naples, where she was very much involved in the affairs of the Kingdom. As queen of Naples, she functioned as the regent of Naples during the absence of Joachim on four occasions: during his participation in the war on Russia in 1812-1813, during his participation in the war in Germany in 1813, during the war against Napoleon in 1814, and, finally, during the return of Napoleon to power in 1815. In 1814, she supported his decision to make a separate peace with the anti-Napoleonic allies, keeping his throne while Napoleon was deposed. Then, during the Hundred Days of 1815, Joachim came out for Napoleon. During his absence, Caroline was left as regent of Naples. Joachim was defeated and executed, and Caroline fled to the Austrian Empire. Whilst in exile, she adopted the title 'Countess of Lipona'; 'Lipona' being an anagram of 'Napoli' (Naples). , who had been Minister of War of the Kingdom of Naples in 1814 and 1815. She lived in Florence until her death in 1839. The couple had no children. Caroline died in 1839 and was buried at the Chiesa di Ognissanti, in Florence. One of her great-great-great-grandsons is the American actor René Auberjonois, who is perhaps best known for portraying the character Odo on . Caroline and Joachim were the parents of four children: </doc> <doc id="2343843" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343843" title="James Kerwin"> James Kerwin James Kerwin, (born October 13, 1973 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American film writer/director and theatre director.

According to The Toyes, "one fine fall day on a small island" of Oahu in Hawaii, two of the band members, Jim and Sandy, were sitting under a large banyan tree on Kuhio Beach, "tokin' on some sweet bud & jammin' on a rootsy reggae funky town" when they conceived the song "Smoke Two Joints." It was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 American comedy-thriller film "Homegrown". The Toyes version was featured in the 2005 video game "NARC". The song is often mistakenly attributed to Bob Marley on the internet and file sharing websites. Marley had been dead two years when this song was written. Norman Nardini, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, created two or more cover versions of this song in the 1980s. One was a studio LP, and another was a version featured on his live CD from 1994, both produced by Circumstantial Records, based in New York City. Norman first came across the song in 1983 when his friend Stush brought home the 45 as part of the music he had bought during a vacation in Hawaii. Nardini had his band learn it at once and has been performing the song for over twenty years. He wanted to air a cover version on CBS in the 1980s, but the label could not track down the original writers. The punk/ska band "Sublime" performed a cover version on their 1992 debut album "40oz. to Freedom". "Smoke Two Joints" was one of the first Sublime songs to be played on the radio after "Date Rape". This cover includes samples taken from the film "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" (though this intro is typically removed when the song is played on the radio), of a bong being used, and of the artists Eazy-E and Just Ice. Bert Susanka, the lead singer of The Ziggens (a major influence on Sublime), is also sampled saying, "Smoked cigarettes 'til the day she died!" The track is also featured on the 2003 film "Grind" and is on the "Grind" motion picture soundtrack as a somewhat shorter version. The track is also used in the film "Mallrats" when the contestants for a game show are passed out on the floor. "Smoke Two Joints" was released in 1994. Sublime's version is featured in the "Rocksmith 2014" video game as a DLC track. </doc> <doc id="2343855" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343855" title="Robert Paterson"> Robert Paterson Robert Paterson may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2343856" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343856" title="Örkény"> Örkény Örkény is a small town in Pest county, Hungary, south of Budapest. The mediaeval village was formed beside the ancient Pest-Constantinople highway. Today this is one of the most important roads of Hungary (Route 5). Örkény appeared in the royal charters in the 15th century under the name "Ewrkyn" or "Ewrken" (the origin of the name is uncertain). The village was destroyed in the early days of the Ottoman rule, and remained deserted until the 18th century because of the constant wars and looting armies. In 1784 a new era began with colonising efforts of Prince Antal Grassalkovich who built a small manor house, and distributed parcels and lots to the new inhabitants. In 1848 the St. Leopold Church was built in elegant Neoclassical style (today it's a national monument). In 1888 the estate was inherited by István Pálóczi Horváth. The new owner has done a lot for the development of the village: he established the famous School of Agriculture, distributed lots to the landless peasants and planted new orchards and vineyards. The Pálóczi Horváth Mansion was built in 1893 (today it is a cultural and community centre). In the 20th century Örkény was transformed by the rapid economical development, the mechanisation of the agriculture and the slow urbanization. This was marked in the 1980s by the building of the new primary school and the health care centre. Örkény became a town in 2005. </doc> <doc id="2343857" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343857" title="WSIL-TV"> WSIL-TV WSIL-TV is an ABC-affiliated television station licensed to Harrisburg, Illinois, United States, serving Southern Illinois, Southeast Missouri, and the Purchase area of Western Kentucky. It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 34 (or virtual channel 3 via PSIP) from a transmitter in Creal Springs, Illinois. Owned by Mel Wheeler, Inc., the station has studios on Country Aire Drive (IL 13) in Carterville. WSIL operates a full-time satellite, KPOB-TV (channel 15) in Poplar Bluff, Missouri. This station airs a high definition digital signal on virtual and UHF channel 15 from a transmitter in the city along US 60/US 67. WSIL does not maintain any offices in Poplar Bluff. WSIL can also be seen on a digital translator, K10KM-D (channel 10), in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. WSIL signed-on for the first time December 1, 1953. It originally broadcast an analog signal on UHF channel 22, but moved to VHF channel 3 in March 1959 as did numerous stations originally assigned to UHF allocations before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) mandated that television-set manufacturers include UHF tuning capability in their products in 1964. The original UHF transmitter had been built in Harrisburg before Paducah, Harrisburg, and Cape Girardeau had been collapsed into one large market. The station moved its facilities from Harrisburg to Carterville in 1989. However, some parts of Southeast Missouri could not receive channel 3's signal clearly, presumably because WSIL had to conform it to protect co-channel WREC-TV (now WREG-TV) in Memphis, Tennessee in the next market to the south. As a result, KPOB signed-on September 15, 1967 to provide service to those counties, although Jonesboro, Arkansas' KAIT (another ABC station) may have been visible in much of the area. WSIL had the unique distinction of being the first station in the market to broadcast a digital signal at a full 1 megawatt of power (equivalent to 5 megawatts in analog) on October 22, 2002. It was also the first to air a mobile digital signal. On January 3, 2018, WSIL and KPOB began airing Heroes & Icons on their .2 subchannels. On October 31, 2018, it was announced that Quincy Media would acquire WSIL and KPOB for $24.5 million, pending FCC approval. WSIL would be Quincy's fourth station in its home state of Illinois. The station's digital channel is multiplexed: Both stations shut down their analog signals, respectively on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows: Syndicated programming on WSIL includes "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", "Rachael Ray", and "The Dr. Oz Show", among others. For many years, WSIL did not air the weeknight broadcasts of ABC News, broadcasting instead a children's show featuring cartoons and "Three Stooges" shorts in the 5:30 to 6:30 time slot. It was not until sometime in the late-1970s it became the last ABC affiliate in the United States to abandon the practice of preempting the network news. However, in ABC's earlier years, quite a number of local stations did not carry the newscasts because their ratings trailed competitors CBS and NBC by a large margin. This changed when ABC initiated the "World News Tonight" format in 1978, finally establishing the network as a significant news operation. The station was one of the ABC affiliates that refused to air "NYPD Blue" during its first season in 1993–1994. Station Manager Steve Wheeler appeared on "Good Morning America" to explain his decision. During the interview with Charlie Gibson, Wheeler announced that if the program was successful, WSIL would reconsider. During this first season, Fox affiliate KBSI aired the program during the assigned network slot Tuesdays nights at 9 Central Time. WSIL's newscasts focus almost exclusively on Southern Illinois, unlike the other big three stations in the area. This is despite the presence of KPOB, which is a straight simulcast of WSIL. In fact, channel 3 does not even mention the market's other two main cities (Paducah and Cape Girardeau) in its on-air identifications, choosing to identify as "Harrisburg/Marion/Carbondale". Its newscasts are known as "News 3" even though program listings online and on cable and satellite services can refer to them as "News 3 News". Unlike most ABC affiliates, WSIL does not air a midday newscast during the week. On January 18, 2004, the news operation underwent a major renovation, including the set, logo and on-air graphics. Some personnel changes were also made. In October 2010, WSIL became the first station in the market to offer news in high definition. </doc> <doc id="2343859" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343859" title="Kudrun"> Kudrun Kudrun (sometimes known as the Gudrunlied or Gudrun), is an anonymous Middle High German heroic epic. The poem was likely composed in either Austria or Bavaria around 1250. It tells the story of three generations of the ruling house of Hetelings on the North Sea, but is primarily the story of Kudrun, who is abducted by the Norman prince Hartmut who desires to marry her. Kudrun remains true to her fiancé Herwig and eventually is rescued. After the defeat of the Normans, however, Kudrun ensures that peace will be kept between the two peoples by arranging for marriages and alliances. Although the story of Kudrun is very likely the invention of the poet, the story of her parents has its origins in a common Germanic tale known in Scandinavia as the "Hjaðningavíg": it tells how Kudrun's mother, Hilde, eloped with her father, Hetel, against the will of Hilde's father, Hagen. In "Kudrun", this originally tragic tale has been transformed into a happy one that serves as the prehistory of Kudrun herself. The poem is notable for the important and active role played by its female characters. It is widely seen as a deliberate antithesis to the "Nibelungenlied", to which it alludes in numerous ways. "Kudrun" does not appear to have been successful with medieval audiences, and survives in only one manuscript. Since its rediscovery, however, it has been popular with philologists, and this has resulted in a relatively wide modern reception. Of German heroic poems, it has been called "second in stature only to the "Nibelungenlied"." The epic tells essentially three stories: the adventures of King Hagen, King Hetel's winning of Hilde, and the trials and triumphs of Princess Kudrun, the latter taking up three-quarters of the work. "Chapters 1-4: How Hagen becomes King of Ireland" In Ireland, Prince Sigebant marries a Norwegian princess, Uote, and becomes king. Three years later she bears him a son, Hagen. At age seven Hagen is carried off to a faraway island by a wild griffin and given to its young. But one of the young is too greedy and flies off with the boy. In the process it accidentally lets him escape. Hagen flees until he finds three young maidens in a cave who have, themselves, escaped the griffins. They proceed to care for him until he is old enough to fend for himself. Then one day, securing weapons and armor from a shipwreck, Hagen is able to single-handedly kill all the griffins. Some time later, after killing a dragon, he drinks its blood and gains superhuman strength and wisdom. Finally all of these young people are rescued by a passing ship. But when it becomes clear that those rescued are to be held for ransom, Hagen uses his strength to take control of the ship and force the crew to sail to Ireland. There Hagen is reunited with his family and the rescued maidens join the royal court. Soon the young prince marries one of the maidens, Hilde of India. She is crowned queen when Hagen becomes king. Later she bears him a daughter, who is also named Hilde and who grows up to become famed for her beauty. "Chapters 5-8: How Hetel of Germany Woos Hilde of Ireland" A warrior king named Hetel rules the Hegelings (or Hetelings) in the area covered today by Northern Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Having heard of Hilde's beauty, he desires to woo her to be his queen. But he is informed that King Hagen kills all her suitors. So he arranges for his kinsmen and vassals, under the leadership of Wate of Stormarn, to mount an expedition and abduct her. The expedition sails in five ships. When the Hegelings land in Ireland they pose as merchants and exiled warriors. With rich gifts and chivalric ways they lull Hagen and his court into a false sense of security. Horant of Denmark, one of the Hegelings, sings so sweetly that he becomes the idol of the ladies. By these means Hilde and her entourage are lured down to the harbor to view the departing ships. Suddenly a group of warriors hidden in one of them emerges, Hilde and her ladies in waiting are abducted, and the ships all sail back to Germany. Enraged, Hagen gathers his forces and soon launches a fleet to attack Hetel's lands. When he reaches the German shore he and his men are met with fierce opposition, including by Hetel himself. The two sides battle to a standstill. Then the conflict is resolved by a truce in which Hilde is betrothed to Hetel. A great wedding follows and Hilde becomes queen of the Hegelings. Hagen then returns to Ireland, laden with gifts and full of praises for how worthy Hetel is as the husband of his daughter. "Chapters 9-12: How Herwic of Sealand Woos Kudrun of Germany" Now it is Hetel's turn to become the father of a famously beautiful daughter who he feels compelled to protect from all suitors. That daughter is Kudrun, who along with her brother Ortwin, is born to Hetel and Hilde. When Kudrun comes of age, Hetel refuses the suits of a Moorish king named Sifrit of Alzabey, a Norman prince named Hartmuot, and King Herwic of Sealand. Herwic thereupon raises an army of 3,000 and attacks Hetel. Hetel fights back with his own army. Soon Herwic and Hetel face each other one-on-one and fight to a standstill. By this point Kudrun has become smitten with the valiant Herwic and wishes to marry him. So Hetel grants her her wish. But Hilde decides to delay the wedding for a year while she prepares Kudrun to be a queen. And so Herwic must wait. "Chapters 13-19: How Kudrun Is Abducted" During that interim period, the jealous King Sifrit invades Herwic's lands with an army of 80,000 and puts his kingdom to the torch. This forces Herwic to seek the aid of the Hegelings who, with Kudrun's prompting, come to his aid. Soon the combined forces are able to corner those of Sifrit and lay a year-long siege. Meanwhile, the equally jealous Norman Prince Hartmuot gathers an army of 23,000 and invades Hetel's lands in his absence. There he abducts Kudrun. When Hetel learns of this, he makes alliance with Sifrit and then, with all of his allies, pursues Hartmuot to the island of Wulpensand off the Dutch coast. The battle there, however, results in massive losses on both sides with no clear victor. But Hetel is killed. And Hartmuot is able to escape in the predawn hours with his remaining forces. So Kudrun's kinsmen must return to the land of the Hegelings with the sad news that Hetel is dead, that Kudrun remains as Hartmuot's captive, and that their forces are now too weak to launch an invasion of the Norman lands. They will have to wait until the boys of the next generation come of age and are able to avenge the deaths of their fathers. "Chapters 20-21: How Kudrun Is Imprisoned" Meanwhile, Hartmuot and his warriors return home. There Kudrun and her ladies in waiting are introduced into the royal household. But because Kudrun declares she can never love Hartmuot and will always regard herself as a captive, she and her attendants are forced by Hartmuot's mother, Queen Gerlint, into the role of castle servants in an effort to break Kudrun's will. This goes on for eight years, but Kudrun remains firm. So Hartmuot asks his sister to take over and try kindness instead. The result is the same: Kudrun never stops refusing to become Hartmuot's queen. So Gerlint takes over again and Kudrun is forced to become the castle washerwoman. "Chapters 22-29: How Kudrun is Finally Freed" It isn’t until thirteen years after Hetel's death that Kudrun's mother, Queen Hilde, declares the time has finally come to invade the Norman kingdom. All of her vassals answer the call, as well as King Herwic, assembling an army of 70,000 that is soon joined by 10,000 more from King Sifrit. The combined forces then set out, pausing at Wulpensand to honor those who died there. Unfortunately, bad weather sends the invasion fleet off course into the Sea of Darkness and near Mount Aetna's magnetic cliffs, where the whole campaign is put in great jeopardy. Yet the ships manage to reach the Norman kingdom and the troops land without being seen. Making a reconnaissance, Herwic, with Kudrun's brother Ortwin, find Kudrun washing clothes by the sea. They don’t immediately recognize her but conversation soon reveals the truth. So they promise they will return the next day to rescue her along with her handmaidens. Armed with this promise, Kudrun takes action to properly prepare herself. She announces to the Normans that she has finally decided to relent and marry Hartmuot, but can do so only if she and her entourage are allowed to bathe, don proper clothes, and get a good night's sleep. These wishes are readily granted and the princess and her ladies are restored to their former status and appearance. Meanwhile, during the night, Wate directs the invading forces to sneak up close to the Norman castle so the attack can be launched suddenly at dawn. Then, as day breaks, the invaders form their lines. In response, Hartmuot musters his troops and marches out of the castle to face his enemies head on. Bloody fighting quickly erupts, with massive casualties on both sides, until Hartmuot determines it would be prudent to retire. But now his men are far from the walls and must fight their way back to gates blocked by the invaders. In this struggle he is soon locked in combat with Wate. At this point, Queen Gerlint in the Norman castle orders Kudrun killed. But Hartmuot, though outside the castle, manages to prevent this. So Kudrun, shouting from a castle window, begs Herwic to intervene between Hartmuot and Wate to stop the fighting. This Herwic does, allowing Hartmuot to be captured instead of killed. But Wate becomes enraged by this and has his troops fight their way into the castle and sack it. Kudrun is rescued and Gerlint is beheaded. "Chapters 30-32: How Kudrun Restores Peace" After Hartmuot's entire realm has been conquered, the invasion force returns to the land of the Hegelings with its captives and shiploads of booty. There Queen Hilde greets them royally. Kudrun then arranges for a great reconciliation in which her brother Ortwin marries Hartmuot's sister, Hartmuot marries Kudrun's close companion, Sifrit marries Herwic's sister, and Herwic, of course, marries Kudrun. All four are wed the same day. Then the four kings—Ortwin, Hartmuot, Sifrit, and Herwic—hold a great festival at Hilde's castle. After this, Hartmuot and his bride are escorted back to the Norman kingdom where he is reinstated as ruler. Herwic's sister leaves with Sifrit to the Moorish kingdom. And Kudrun bids her mother and brother farewell as she departs with Herwic to Sealand. In common with almost all other German heroic poems, the "Kudrun" is anonymous. The poem is only transmitted in the early sixteenth-century Ambraser Heldenbuch, but it is conventionally dated to around 1250. The scribe of that manuscript has modernized the language of the poem, but he has done it in such a way that the text is often incomprehensible unless translated back into Middle High German. The earliest date that it could have been composed is around 1240; the author has to have known the "Nibelungenlied" and the text portrays the relationship between kings and vassals in a manner suggestive of Emperor Frederick II's "Statutum in favorem principum". Although the story takes place on the North Sea, the author of the poem does not seem well acquainted with maritime geography; further proof that he was not familiar with the ocean comes from his portrayal of Kudrun washing clothes in the sea. This accords with the linguistic analysis of the poem, which locates it in the Austro-Bavarian dialect area; potential places of composition include Styria and Regensburg. The first half of the "Kudrun" is a reworking of a common Germanic oral tradition that likely has its origins around the North Sea, with the portrayal of warfare being similar to that of the Viking Age. Based on the forms of names found in the text, this tradition likely reached the southern German-speaking area where the "Kudrun" was composed via the Dutch-Flemish language area and potentially through a romance-speaking area. The core of this tradition is the story of Hilde's abduction and a battle on an island between her father Hagen and her abductor Hetel. This tradition is attested in Germany as early as the middle of the twelfth century, when a fierce battle on the island "Wolfenwerde" (in "Kudrun", "Wülpensand") is mentioned in Priest Lambrecht's "Alexanderroman": "Hilde's father" is said to perish in the battle, and the names Hagen and Wate are given. The version of events reported by Priest Lambrecht accords generally with other attestations, namely from Scandinavia, where it is known as Hjaðningavíg. Snorri Sturluson reports two versions of the tale in the "Prose Edda": in one, Hildr (Hilde) attempts to mediate between her father Högni (Hagen) and Heðin (Hetel) during the battle and awakens the dead to life every night. In another, quoted from the poem "Ragnarsdrápa", Hildr encourages the fight and prevents its end. Another version is reported by Saxo Grammaticus. The earliest attestation of the saga appears to be a picture stone (Smiss I) from Gotland, Sweden, which shows a woman attempting to mediate between warriors on land and on a ship. The saga is also attested in Anglo-Saxon England of the ninth and tenth centuries, where the poems "Deor" and "Widsith" mention the names Hagena (Hagen), Heoden (Hetel), Wada (Wate), and Heorrenda (Horant) without, however, giving any indication of their story. The German "Kudrun" differs from the Norse versions and the version found in Priest Lambrecht in that Hilde is able to successfully mediate between Hagen and Hetel, transforming the story of Hilde into prologue to the story of her daughter, Kudrun. The story of Kudrun herself was likely the invented by the poet based on the story of Hilde, as there are no independent attestations of Kudrun. It is nevertheless not possible to prove that there were no oral traditions about Kudrun. The name "Kudrun" shows signs of having migrated with the oral tradition south to Baviara/Austria: it would be "*Gundrūn" if it had arisen in the High German area. The form "*Gudrun" may be of Dutch origin and probably derives from the Old Norse "Guðrún" (see Gudrun). It is unclear whether the poem's German audience was aware that Kudrun's name was equivalent to the Norse version of Kriemhild or whether the name has some other explanation. The story of Hagen's youth in the wilderness is thought to have been invented by the poet using motifs taken from "Herzog Ernst", the "Nibelungenlied", and Wolfram von Eschenbach's "Parzival". The "Kudrun" is widely seen as a deliberate reversal of the situation of the "Nibelungenlied": the poem cites the "Nibelungenlied" in its metrical form, in its use of "âventiuren" (chapters, literally "adventures") to distinguish individual episodes, and its use of allusions and direct citations of lines of the other poem. Kudrun herself is seen as a reversal of Kriemhild in the "Nibelungenlied": instead of revenge and destruction, Kudrun brings about peace and reconciliation. Gerlint, however, receives Kriemhild's epithet "vâlentinne" (Kudrun 629,4; "she-devil"), while Wate seems to combine features of the "Nibelungenlied's" portrayal of Hagen and Hildebrand. While the antithesis to the "Nibelungenlied" is especially obvious in the role played by Kudrun herself, the male family members also show themselves to be much more pragmatic than the heroes in the "Nibelungenlied". The central topic of "Kudrun" is reconciliation, a reconciliation which is secured through the marriage of members of formerly feuding families. The poem features female protagonists who are far more active than is typical; in particular, Kudrun herself intervenes repeatedly to prevent bloodshed and to secure peace. Kudrun's mother Hilde is also an active female figure, who rules in her own right following Hetel's death; Kudrun and Hilde are together responsible for the success of Kudrun's attempts to create a lasting peace. The poem nevertheless does not call male rule into question: female power is unable to challenge male power and is always based in prior suffering. The "Kudrun" is written in a variant of the stanza used in the "Nibelungenlied"; the stanza consists of four lines. The first three lines consist of three metrical feet, a caesura, and an additional three metrical feet. The fourth line adds an additional two metrical feets after the caesura. The lines rhyme in couplets. The first rhyming couplet has a "masculine" rhyme (a single stressed syllable). The second couplet has a "feminine" rhyme (a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one). The word before the caesura is typically feminine, and there are frequently words that rhyme between the caesuras of a couplet. The following, stanza 699 taken from Uta Störmer-Caysa's edition, is an example of this stanza type. || represents the caesura: A number of stanzas are written in the same form as the "Nibelungenlied". The aesthetic of "Kudrun" can be described as a montage of various elements from various genres and texts. This technique results in a certain degree of inconsistency in the poem. The poem is also notable for its use of memorable poetic description of images and jestures. The "Kudrun" does not appear to have been a very popular poem in the Middle Ages; it is never alluded to elsewhere and it survives only in a single manuscript. Its lack of influence may have to do with the fact that it is a more consciously literary text than the "Nibelungenlied" or the other late medieval heroic epics about Dietrich von Bern. There are nevertheless certain areas where influence from "Kudrun" has been proposed: the Old Yiddish "Dukus Horant" and various ballads. "Dukus Horant", which involves characters from the Hilde part of "Kudrun", more likely is an independent reworking of the Hilde saga than of "Kudrun". For a lack of a direct connection between the two epics speaks "Dukus Horant's" use of the name "Etene" for Hetel; this more closely matches the Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon material than "Kudrun". Several ballads in various European languages show parallels to Kudrun's captivity and rescue, with German examples being the "Südeli" ballads (18th century) and the "Meererin" (written down 1867). Their relationship to "Kudrun" is uncertain and most scholars now believe that it is more likely that the parallels show that the author of the "Kudrun" reworked traditional folk elements in composing the second half of the poem. Perhaps for the same reasons that the epic was unpopular as heroic poetry in the Middle Ages, namely its literary character, the "Kudrun" became extremely popular with nineteenth-century philologists. This resulted in the work being adapted several times. In 1868, author Mathilde Wesendonck published a play "Gudrun", which was among her more popular pieces and which Johannes Brahms offered to base an opera on. Several operas based on the poem were actually completed: Carl Amand Mangold completed one in 1849, as did Oscar Block in 1865, August Reissmann in 1871, Felix Draeseke in 1883, and Hans Huber in 1894. </doc> <doc id="2343860" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343860" title="Mitch Snyder"> Mitch Snyder Mitch Snyder (August 14, 1943 – July 3, 1990) was an American advocate for the homeless. He was the subject of a made-for-television 1986 biopic, "Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story", starring Martin Sheen. Snyder grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, where at age 9 his father abandoned the family. After a stint in a correctional facility for breaking into parking meters, Snyder worked in job counseling on Madison Avenue in New York City, as well as selling appliances and construction work. In 1969 he left his wife and children and started hitchhiking west. Police found him in a stolen vehicle, and he was arrested and convicted of grand theft auto. He served two years in federal prison, 1970–1972, for violating the Dyer Act, which outlaws the interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle. Snyder ended up in Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, where he served time with Philip and Daniel Berrigan. Following meetings with them and prolific reading, especially of the Bible, Snyder started participating in hunger strikes and work stoppages over prisoners' rights issues. Upon being released in 1973 Snyder came home to rejoin his family. Less than one year later he left his family again and joined the Community for Creative Non Violence (CCNV) in Washington, D.C. CCNV was at that time operating a medical clinic, a pretrial house, a soup kitchen, a thrift store and a halfway house. CCNV came out of a discussion group about the Vietnam War at George Washington University. CCNV was also very active in nonviolent direct action in opposition to the Vietnam War. Snyder became the driving force of CCNV but worked with many deeply committed people including his wife and professional partner, Carol Fennelly; Mary Ellen Hombs, with whom he co authored "Homelessness in America: A Forced March to Nowhere"; and Ed and Kathleen Guinan. He and CCNV pushed and prodded the District of Columbia, the local churches and temples and mosques, as well as the federal government to open space at night for homeless people, and worked to staff the space that was made available. Through demonstrations, public funerals for people who had frozen to death on DC streets, breaking into public buildings, and fasting, CCNV forced the creation of shelters in Washington and made homelessness a national and international issue. In the 1980s Snyder, Fennelly, and other CCNV activists entered and occupied an abandoned federal building at 425 2nd Street N.W. (now Mitch Snyder Place) and housed hundreds overnight while demanding that the government renovate the building. Under intense pressure, the Reagan administration agreed to lease the Federal property to CCNV for $1 a year. Later the Federal government transferred the property to DC. It remains the largest shelter in Washington to this day. Snyder fasted twice to force the Reagan administration to renovate the building. The first fast ended on the eve of Reagan's second election when Reagan promised to execute necessary repairs. Reagan failed to follow through on this promise, and litigation ensued. An Oscar-nominated documentary, "Promises to Keep", narrated by Martin Sheen, follows that story and tells why a second fast was conducted. Sheen also played Mitch Snyder in the made-for-TV movie, "Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story". Angered that Holy Trinity Parish in Georgetown planned an expensive renovation of that historic church, and maintaining that the money involved should be given instead to the poor, Snyder stood in the middle of the congregation throughout the Sunday Mass for many weeks as a protest, while other congregants knelt or sat during the service as was customary. In 1985, Snyder and CCNV hired sculptor James Earl Reid to create a display for the annual Christmastime Pageant of Peace in Washington which would dramatize the plight of the homeless. The display, titled "Third World America," featured a nativity scene in which the Holy Family was represented by contemporary homeless people huddled around a steam grate. The figures were atop a pedestal that stated "And Still There is No Room at the Inn." In 1986, Snyder and CCNV wanted to take "Third World America" on tour, but Reid refused. Snyder and CCNV sued Reid, claiming that "Third World America" was a work for hire under § 101 of the United States Copyright Act. In the case "Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid", the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the sculpture was not a work for hire because Reid was not an employee under the general common law of agency. Thus, the work was not subject to the § 201(b) rule that when a work is made for hire, the employer is considered the author. In 1989 Snyder gave a presentation at the American Library Association conference which was published in the journal, "Public Libraries". Just three months before his death, Snyder and his companion of 15 years, Carol Fennelly, had announced that they would marry in September on the street in front of the 1,400-bed shelter that had been the focus of Snyder's work. But their relationship faltered and Snyder hanged himself in his room at the CCNV shelter in July 1990, where his body remained for several days before being discovered. Snyder's suicide note spoke of Carol Fennelly, stating that he wished she loved him as much as he loved her. He is survived by Fennelly, his ex-wife, and his two sons. A collection of primary source material related to Mitch Snyder is currently under the care of the Special Collections Research Center at The George Washington University. The materials include diaries, correspondence, legal documents, articles, photographs, and family papers. </doc> <doc id="2343863" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343863" title="Jim Pepper"> Jim Pepper Jim Pepper (June 18, 1941 - February 10, 1992) was a Kaw-Muscogee Native American jazz saxophonist, composer, and singer. He came to prominence in the late 1960s as a member of The Free Spirits, an early jazz-rock fusion group who first recorded his best-known song, "Witchi Tai-To." Pepper went on to a lengthy career in jazz, recording almost a dozen albums as a bandleader and appearing as sideman with the likes of drummer Paul Motian and pianist Mal Waldron, often incorporating elements of Native American music into his style. He died of lymphoma, aged 50. Jim Gilbert Pepper II was born on June 18, 1941 to Gilbert and Floy Pepper in Salem, Oregon. He grew up in Portland. He attended Parkrose High School and Madison High School (Portland, Oregon). Beginning in the late 1960s, Pepper became a pioneer of fusion jazz. His band, The Free Spirits (active between 1965 and 1968, with guitarist Larry Coryell), is credited as the first to combine elements of jazz and rock. His primary instrument was the tenor saxophone (he also played flute and soprano saxophone). A similar timbre was taken up by later players such as Jan Garbarek, Michael Brecker, and David Sanborn. Of Kaw and Creek heritage, Pepper also achieved notoriety for his compositions combining elements of jazz and Native American music. Don Cherry and Ornette Coleman encouraged Pepper to reflect his roots and heritage and incorporate it into his jazz playing and composition. He was musical director for "Night of the First Americans", a Native American self-awareness benefit concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. in 1980 and played also at numerous powwows. Pepper supported the American Indian Movement. Pepper was a member of the short-lived band "Everything Is Everything" with Chris Hills, Lee Reinoehl, Chip Baker, John Waller and Jim Zitro. Their 1969 self-titled sole album spawned the near-hit single "Witchi Tai To" (which received abundant airplay reaching number 69 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and on which Pepper was the lead singer). It was issued on Vanguard Apostolic and UK Vanguard in England, and is the only hit to feature an authentic Native American chant in the history of the Billboard pop charts. His "Witchi Tai To" (derived from a peyote song of the Native American Church which he had learned from his grandfather) is the most famous example of his hybrid (jazz/Native American) style; the song has been covered by many other artists including Harper's Bizarre, Ralph Towner (with and without Oregon), Jan Garbarek, Pete Wyoming Bender, Brewer & Shipley, Larry Smith with members of The Bonzo Dog Band, Yes and Keith Moon under the pseudonym of Topo D. Bill, and an unreleased version recorded by The Supremes in 1969. It was also covered in 1973 by Quebec singer-songwriter Robert Charlebois. Jim Pepper played the iconic saxophone solo on the Classic Four's hit "Spooky" which led to him doing a large amount of studio work in Los Angeles and paid him royalties for years thereafter. In his own projects, Pepper recorded with Don Cherry, Naná Vasconcelos, Collin Walcott, Kenny Werner, John Scofield, Ed Schuller, Hamid Drake, and many others. His CD "Comin' and Goin' " (1984) is the definitive statement of Pepper's unique "American Indian jazz" with nine songs played by four different line-ups. It was also the first CD issued by the then-new all-CD label Rykodisc. He also worked with the Liberation Music Orchestra, Paul Motian' s quintet, Bob Moses, Marty Cook, Mal Waldron, David Friesen, Tony Hymas and Amina Claudine Myers, and toured Europe intensively throughout his career. Jim Pepper died on February 10, 1992, of lymphoma. In 1998, composer Gunther Schuller arranged, conducted and recorded "The Music of Jim Pepper" for symphony orchestra and jazz band. Pepper was posthumously granted the "Lifetime Musical Achievement Award" by First Americans in the Arts in 1999, and in 2000 he was inducted into the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame. In 2005 the Oregon Legislative Assembly honored the extraordinary accomplishments and musical legacy of Pepper. In 2008 the New York-based band Effi Briest released a version of Pepper's "Newly-Wed Song" as the B-side to their début single, "Mirror Rim" on Loog Records. In 1969, Harpers Bizarre covered "Witchi Tai To" on the album "Harpers Bizarre 4". In 1973, Robert Charlebois covered "Witchi Tai To" on the album "Solidaritude". The same recording was republished on different compilations of Robert Charlebois. In 2001, Future Pilot AKA covered "Witchi Tai To" on the album "Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea". In April 2007, the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. accepted Pepper's saxophone and hat at a ceremony honoring his music and legacy.

He is most notable for his documentary "Stop Genocide", made during the Bangladesh Liberation War. He was awarded Ekushey Padak in 1977 and Independence Day Award in 1992 by the Government of Bangladesh. Raihan was born Mohammad Zahirullah on 19 August 1935 in Majupur village, in Feni District. After the Partition of Bengal in 1947, he, along with his parents, returned to his village from Calcutta. He obtained his bachelor's in Bengali from the University of Dhaka. Raihan received his post graduate degree in Bengali literature. Along with literary works, Raihan started working as a journalist when he joined "Juger Alo" in 1950. Later he also worked in newspapers, namely "Khapchhara", "Jantrik", and "Cinema". He also worked as the editor of "Probaho" in 1956. His first collection of short stories, titled "Suryagrahan", was published in 1955. He worked as an assistant director on the Urdu film "Jago Hua Savera" in 1957. This was his first direct involvement in film. He also assisted Salahuddin in the film "Je Nadi Marupathe". The filmmaker Ehtesham also employed him on his movie "E Desh Tomar Amar", for which he wrote the title song. In 1960, he made his directorial début with his film "Kokhono Asheni", which was released in 1961. In 1964, he made Pakistan's first colour movie, "Sangam", and completed his first CinemaScope movie, "Bahana", the following year. He was an active supporter of the Language Movement of 1952 and was present at the historical meeting of Amtala on 21 February 1952. The effect of the Language Movement was so strong on him that he used it as the premise of his landmark film "Jibon Theke Neya". He also took part in the 1969 Mass uprising in East Pakistan. In 1971 he joined in the Liberation War of Bangladesh and created documentary films on the subject. During the war of liberation Raihan went to Calcutta, where his film "Jibon Theke Neya" was shown. His film was highly acclaimed by Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Ritwik Ghatak. Though he was in financial difficulties at the time, he gave all his money from the Calcutta showing to the Freedom Fighters trust. Raihan had been married twice, to Sumita Devi in 1961 and Shuchonda in 1968, both of whom were film actresses. With Sumita he had two sons, Bipul Raihan and Anol Raihan. He, with Shuchonda, had also two sons named Opu Raihan and Topu Raihan. Raihan disappeared on 30 January 1972 trying to locate his brother, a notable writer Shahidullah Kaiser, who was captured and killed by the Pakistan army and/or local collaborators during the final days of the liberation war. It is believed that he was killed with many others when armed Bihari collaborators and soldiers of the Pakistan Army who were hiding fired on them when they went to Mirpur, a suburb of the capital city of Dhaka that was one of few strongholds for Pakistani/Bihari collaborators at that time. </doc> <doc id="2343883" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343883" title="Depression (geology)"> Depression (geology) A depression in geology is a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area.

The city is named for Rajsamand Lake, an artificial lake created in the 17th century by Rana Raj Singh of Mewar. It is the administrative headquarters of Rajsamand District. Rajsamand is located at . It has an average elevation of 547 metres (1794 ft). Total population of the Rajsamand district is 987,024 (493,459 male and 493,565 female). This district has a male to female ratio of nearly 1:1. Rajsamand has an average literacy rate of 67%, male literacy is 77%, and female literacy is 57%. In Rajsamand, 15% of the population is under 6 years of age. Although most of the economy of Rajasthan is based on agriculture, this part of the state is rich in mineral resources. The area is one of the prime Indian suppliers of marble, granite and other valuable varieties of stone. The Dariba and Jawar mines are the principal Indian sources of ores for zinc, silver, manganese, etc. The majority of the population is engaged in organised and unorganised mining-related works. Others are engaged in tyre and tobacco factories. Located at about 62km away from the magnificent city of Udaipur (the city of lakes), Rajsamand itself is quite naturally endowed with eye-catching beauty. Surrounded by the wide ranges of Aravali, it houses the stunning Rajsamand Lake. Kumbhalgarh Fort is another breathtaking architectural marvel that's a must-see in the district. Located on a hilltop, it's known for its humongous boundary wall that's second only to the Great Wall of China in size. From a cultural point of view, a village in Rajsamand that has made a mark in the world is the village of Piplantri. It's famed for the practice of village-members planting 111 plants every time a girl child is born in the village. </doc> <doc id="2343930" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343930" title="Andrew Baxter"> Andrew Baxter Andrew Baxter (1686/1687, Aberdeen23 April 1750, Whittingehame, East Lothian) was a Scottish metaphysician. Baxter was educated at King's College, University of Aberdeen. He maintained himself by acting as tutor to noblemen's sons. From 1741 to 1747 he lived with Lord Blantyre and Mr Hay of Drummelzier at Utrecht, and made excursions in Flanders, France and Germany. Returning to Scotland, he lived at Whittingehame, near Edinburgh, until his death in 1750. At Spa he had met John Wilkes, then twenty years old, and formed a lasting friendship with him. Baxter's chief work, "An Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul" (editions 1733, 1737 and 1745; with appendix added in 1750 in answer to an attack in Maclaurin's "Account of Sir I. Newton's Philosophical Discoveries", and dedication to John Wilkes), examines the properties of matter. It described the one essential property of matter as its inactivity, "vis inertiae" (accepted later by Monboddo). All movement in matter is, therefore, caused by some immaterial force, namely, God. But the movements of the body are not analogous to the movements of matter; they are caused by a special immaterial force, the soul. The soul, as being immaterial, is immortal, and its consciousness does not depend upon its connection with the body. He claimed the argument was supported by an analysis of the phenomena of dreams, which are ascribed to direct spiritual influences. Lastly Baxter attempted to prove that matter is finite. Baxter's "Inquiry" met rather different reactions. E.g. it was criticized by Benjamin Franklin in a letter which pointed on Baxter's lack of understand in mechanics, yet left a lasting impression on Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who said, 'I should not wonder if I found that Andrew had thought more on the subject of Dreams than any other of our Psychologists, Scotch or English'. His work is an attack on John Toland's "Letters to Serena" (1704), which argued that motion is essential to matter, and on Locke and Berkeley. His criticism of Berkeley (in the second volume) is, however, based on the common misinterpretation of his theory. Sir Leslie Stephen described him as a curious example of "the effects of an exploded metaphysics on a feeble though ingenious intellect". Baxter's ideas on dreams were contested by Thomas Branch in his "Thoughts on Dreaming" (1738). </doc> <doc id="2343936" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343936" title="Graben, Vienna"> Graben, Vienna The Graben () is one of the most famous streets in Vienna's first district, the city centre. It begins at Stock-im-Eisen-Platz next to the Palais Equitable and ends at the junction of Kohlmarkt and Tuchlauben. Another street in the first district is called "Tiefer Graben" (deep ditch). It is crossed by Wipplinger Straße by means of the "Hohe Brücke", a bridge about ten metres above street level. The Graben traces its origin back to the old Roman encampment of "Vindobona". The south-western wall of the settlement extended along the length of the present-day Graben and Naglergasse; before the wall lay a trench ("Graben"). This trench still stood in front of the medieval city walls. At the end of the 12th century, the city was enlarged by the Babenberg Dukes, using the ransom money for Richard the Lionheart. At this time the trench was filled in and levelled. The Graben thereby became one of the first residential streets in the new section of the city. In this area of the city large unbuilt areas were still available, which probably contributed to the maintenance of the name "Graben" up until the present day. The planned character of the city extension is still visible in the differing characters of the building patterns to the north and to the south of the Graben. The building pattern on the north side (that of the old city) has remained irregular to this day, and only one, narrow side-street opens off the Graben to the north: the "Jungferngässchen", which gives access to the Peterskirche. On the other hand, five regular side-streets were constructed to the south of the Graben in the 13th century: the "Obere Bräunerstraße"(today known as Habsburgergasse), the "Untere Bräunerstraße" (Bräunerstraße), the "Färberstraße" (Dorotheergasse), the "Laderstraße" (Spiegelgasse), and the "Reifstraße" (Seilergasse). Although at first these side-streets remained relatively underbuilt, the situation rapidly changed. According to the historian Karl Oettinger, the Graben replaced the Hoher Markt and Wipplingerstraße as Vienna's main arterial road. The new route supposedly led from Am Hof over Bognergasse and the Graben to Stock-im-Eisen-Platz, at that point turning in the direction of the Stephansdom, then passing over Rotenturmstraße to reach the Wollzeile. Traffic would therefore no longer have needed to pass through the main market at Hoher Markt. However, as there was little reason at the time to travel in the direction of the Schottentor, this theory has been disputed. At that time the Graben was lined primarily with wooden houses, which led to a catastrophe on March 23, 1327. A fire broke out in the Wallnerstraße house of a priest of the Stephansdom, Heinrich von Luzern, and quickly spread over Kohlmarkt to the Graben, destroying the area completely. King Frederick the Handsome participated in the rescue effort. At that time the Graben had not yet become a preferred residence for the nobility; its seems that its residents were primarily Swabians, who had come to Vienna in the time of Rudolph I. The only building known from this time is the "Freisingerhof" (see below). At the turn of the 14th century, houses were built at both ends of the Graben. This activity led to the construction of the "Paternostergässchen", an extension of the Naglergasse, at the northwestern end, and at the southwestern end of the "Grabengasse" and the infamously narrow "Schlossergässchen", where the metal-workers ("Schlosser") built their workshops. Other craftsmen, including blacksmiths, were found at this spot. The narrowness of the Schlossergässchen was a source of constant criticism as an obstruction to the flow of traffic. On account of these new constructions, the Graben came to be seen more as a piazza than as a street. It was however not yet an exclusive address, particularly as the so-called "Mörung" originated there. This was a stream used for sewage disposal, and gave rise to a corresponding stench. Over time, however, various local dignitaries took up residence on the Graben, at first primarily the wealthy bourgeoisie. Although the form of the Graben remained more or less the same, its character began to change. It was marked above all by the construction of the "Arkadenhof", a striking Renaissance building, which in 1873 was replaced by the present-day Grabenhof. The Graben became the site of various festivities, including public displays of homage to the ruling house. This prompted the residents to rebuild their houses and to deck out their facades. In 1701 the old Peterskirche was torn down, and the new structure was completed in 1708. In the course of the 18th century the use of the Graben as a market was suppressed. In 1753 the produce-sellers were removed, and in 1772 the Christmas market was relocated. The Graben became the most fashionable promenade, the chief arena for the self-display of the urban elite. This was not limited to the nobility, but included the entrepreneurial class as well, who were most visibly represented by the construction of the "Trattnerhof" by the printer Thomas von Trattner. Prostitutes were also in evidence — the famous "Grabennymphen". The ascendancy of the Graben resumed at the start of the 19th century. It became the site of ever more luxury shops, marked by artistically significant signs. On account of this growth in business, and the corresponding increase in traffic, the housing blocks on either side of the Graben were increasingly seen as obstructions. In 1835 the Erste österreichische Sparkasse had the corner houses on Tuchlauben torn down and erected its headquarters, which stand to this day, in their stead. In 1840 the buildings on the northwestern end of the Graben followed in their wake. Between 1860 and 1866 the houses between Grabengasse and Schlossergassl were removed, with the result that the Graben led directly to Stock-im-Eisen-Platz, and became once more a proper street. In fact, nearly all the houses on the Graben disappeared, with the exception of the Palais Bartolotti-Partenfeld. The Jungferngässchen was widened, and an open passage to the Peterskirche was created. Even the Trattnerhof was replaced by two new buildings in 1911, between which a second passage to the old city was opened. With the increase in car traffic, the Graben also became a heavily traveled street. However, traffic was limited, as previously, to the southern half of the street. On December 4, 1950, the first neon lights in Vienna were installed here. Numerous plans for the development of the Graben were proposed, including two for its surveillance. On November 22, 1974, the Graben became, on a provisional basis, Vienna's first pedestrian zone. In the course of the construction of the U-Bahn, the Graben was rebuilt in successive phases, and the pedestrian zone was gradually expanded. In this connection, development proposals from five architects and architectural firms were commissioned. The proposal of "Gruppe M" for the roofing of the Graben was hotly debated. Today the Graben is again one of the most important promenades and shopping streets in Vienna. The Graben has served as a marketplace from the very beginning. Already in 1295, shortly after the Graben was first named in documents, a fruit dealer was mentioned. The selling of cabbage began around 1320, and other vegetables were introduced around a hundred years later. These products lent the Graben the additional names of "Grüner Markt" and "Kräutermarkt". Beginning in the 14th century, flour and bread sellers are also mentioned. In 1442 the bakers were granted permission to sell their own wares. The so-called "Brotbänke", which the bakers were required to rent, originated on the Graben. The Paternostergässchen was occupied by the "Paternosterer", makers of rosaries. Beginning in 1424, butchers are also mentioned in treasury documents, which strictly regulate their opening hours. According to a decree issued in 1564 by Ferdinand I, the butchers were to be moved on account of their offensive smell, but the law did not meet with full compliance. In the 18th century the commercial activity was pushed increasingly into the outlying buildings, and in 1753 the last-remaining market (the vegetable market) was shut down. On account of its location and size the Graben was particularly suitable for festival processions. "Fronleichnamsprozessionen" (processions on the occasion of the Feast of Corpus Christi) are first mentioned in 1438, but probably took place even earlier. With the arrival of Protestantism, these processions played a particularly important role in the demonstration of Catholic faith. During the era of Emperor Charles VI, daily masses were held at the Pestsäule. In the 18th century processions took place nearly every week, but this was curtailed by Empress Maria Theresa. Finally, Emperor Joseph II forbade all processions save the Corpus Christi. The Graben also served as a site for triumphal processions, in particular for the arrival of Archdukes and Emperors. It is known to have also been the site of the public displays of homage, at which the notables demonstrated their reverence for the rulers. Such displays are first mentioned in 1620, in the era of Emperor Ferdinand II. The Freisingerhof was the first monumental building on the Graben. The See of Freising owned a plot here on which they built a "Hof" (court), presumably at the end of the 12th century, although it is first mentioned in 1273. The irregular Romanesque building served on the one hand as an administrative center for the see's estates in the area of Vienna, and on the other hand as accommodation for the bishops of Freising and their diplomatic representatives. It was originally known as the "Dompropsthof"; the first document designating it as the "Freisingerhof" dates to the year 1468. Besides the main building, the Hof included other surrounding houses. Johann Thomas Trattner purchased the Hof in 1773, and commissioned a new residence from Peter Mollner. The structure, which was completed in 1776, was enormous for its time. Opinions regarding the building were divided. While its sheer size was impressive, its numerous small rooms and vaults were criticized. The building was officially named the "Trattnernhof", as befits the noble title "von Trattner," but the name "Trattnerhof" prevailed in common practice. The entrance portals were decorated with caryatids by Tobias Kögler. The house remained in the possession of the Trattner family until the beginning of the 19th century. In 1911 it was replaced by two office buildings, built by Rudolf Krauß and Felix Sauer, which were separated by a narrow alley, which provided for the first time a second passage into the old city. The alley still bears the name "Trattnerhof". This residential building was erected between 1894 and 1895 by Otto Wagner, presumably for himself. Its name owes to the fact that the previous building had been purchased by the insurance firm "Der Anker". The style of the lower storey, with its large glass surfaces, points forward to later construction techniques with reinforced concrete. Beginning in 1971 the building was used by Friedensreich Hundertwasser. The palace of the Barons Bartolotti von Partenfeld is the only baroque structure on the Graben that has survived to this day. This building, first erected between 1794 and 1795 by Peter Mollner and Ernest Koch, was rebuilt in 1831 by Josef Klee. This was the site of Leopold Kozeluch's music shop. In 1894 the "Assicurazione Generali" acquired the house, renovating the facade and adding a penthouse. Knize, a prominent tailor, occupied the ground floor; its showroom was built by Adolf Loos. The Grabenhof, also known as the "Thienemannhof", is a historicizing work built between 1873 and 1874 by Otto Thienemann and Otto Wagner on the site of the old "Arkadenhof". The roof was rebuilt in 1947 by Alfons Hetmanek. It is today owned by the Österreichische Beamtenversicherung, and has been used since 1991 as a site for cultural events. On June 18, 1994, a memorial plaque for Josef Sonnleithner, who lived in the Arkadenhof until 1874, was erected. Sonnleithner was the founder of the "Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Wien" (Society of the Friends of Music in Vienna). The expansion of the Erste österreichische Sparkasse gave rise to numerous changes of headquarters in its early years. In 1825 the bank moved into the house at Graben 21. It soon purchased three neighboring houses, which were torn down, and between 1835 and 1839 the architect Alois Pichl constructed the new headquarters. The Pestsäule was constructed by Emperor Leopold I following the Great Plague of Vienna. Two fountains are found on the Graben. Already in 1455, expenditures for a fountain are found in the city account books. This fountain stood on the northwestern end of the Graben and served primarily to put out fires. As it was decorated with four lion's heads, it was known as the "Löwenbrunnen" (lion fountain). The second, southwestern, fountain was presumably built in 1561. When in 1638 it was decided to establish new fire regulations, new fountains on the Freyung and the Graben were likewise deemed necessary. The two fountains were therefore rebuilt. At the behest of Leopold I, the fountains were adorned with sculptures of Saints Joseph and Leopold, which were executed by the sculptor Johann Frühwirth. These were later replaced with lead figures by Johann Martin Fischer. Frühwirth's statues have since been lost. It is unclear to what degree the Graben served as an arterial road in the Middle Ages (see above). The construction of buildings at either end eventually rendered it unsuitable for such a function. However, after the regularization of the 19th century, it became one of the most heavily travelled streets in Vienna, and that even before the arrival of cars. Traffic was always permitted only on the southwestern end. Already in the 19th century, numerous coaches-for-hire were found on the Graben. Beginning on March 1, 1912, the first bus-line in the city ran from Stephansplatz via the Graben to the Volksoper. Later, numerous bus-lines would travel the Graben. In connection with the construction of the U-Bahn, the Graben became a pedestrian zone. A test-run of the pedestrian zone was inaugurated at the Christmas parade on November 27, 1971. The final project for the establishment of the pedestrian zone was the work of Hermann Stiegholzer, and was inaugurated in 1978. The project was completed in 1988 with the incorporation of the stretch between Peterskirche and the Kohlmarkt. The U-Bahn Line U3 has run under the portion between Stock-im-Eisen-Platz and Jungferngasse since 1991. Stephansplatz Station had already been built as a shell during the original construction of the U-1, rendering its extension under the Graben necessary. An exit from this station leads up to the Graben. This is unroofed, in an attempt to render it as unobtrusive as possible. Incorporation of the exit into the neighboring buildings was not possible, on account of the high compensatory payments that would have been necessary.

It is located on the River Coquet, roughly 6 miles south of Alnwick and around 3 miles west of Amble. Guyzance is one of only two places in Great Britain with a "-zance" ending; the other is Penzance in Cornwall. The similar names are co-incidence however. The name Guyzance is thought to be derived from a Norman family name "Guines", from an area of the same name near Calais. Other forms of the name recorded locally include "Gynis" (1242), "Gysnes" and "Gisyng". The village of Guyzance has existed since at least since 1242, when Robert de Hilton was its owner. In 1147, a Premonstratensian Order priory was founded at nearby Brainshaugh. In 1885, Guyzance was described thus in Whellan's "History, Topography, and Directory of Northumberland": ""GUYZANCE, or GUYSON, is a township and village in this Shilbottle parish, the property of the Duke of Northumberland; Robert Delisle, Esq. the heirs of the late Thomas Fenwick, Esq., and Thomas Tate, Esq. The rateable value is £l,671 10s., and the tithes, which are the properly of Thomas Tate, Esq., are valued at £130 per annum. The number of inhabitants in 1801, was 172; in 1811, 186; in 1821, 173; in 1831, 197; in 184l, 205; and in 1851, 213 souls. THE VILLAGE of Guyzance is situated seven miles south by east of Alnwick. There was formerly a priory here, which was annexed to Alnwick Abbey, by Eustace Fitz John. We find from Tanner's Monastica that it was endowed with a portion of the tithes, and two bovates of land, but as to any other portion of its history we possess no records. The remains of the old chapel are still here, with the burying ground, in which the Tate family are still interred. BANK HOUSE, the seat of Thomas Tate, Esq., is situated about a mile north of the village."" The present centre of the hamlet lies to the north of a large meander in the River Coquet, and there was settlement near the neck of the meander in medieval times. This is known as Guyzance in official records, and it is likely that the Norman settlement was located in this southern location, rather than the later northern one. The Prior of Brinkburn and the Abbot of Alnwick held part of the area in the 15th century, but this changed again with the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. The nunnery was known as "Gysnes", an early form of Guyzance, while the church was known as Gisyng, and although officially in the Chapelry of Brainshaugh, was normally referred to as Guyzance church. The mill to the west is also known as Guyzance Mill, and was first established around 1336, while the weir dates from around 1350. In 1472 ownership of the hamelt passed to the Percy family, owners of Warkworth Castle, while in 1567, William Carr of Whitton was recorded as the owner. By the 17th century, there were two rows of dwellings in Guyzance, and the common land had been enclosed by 1685. The evidence is not conclusive, but it would appear that the centre of the hamlet had moved northwards by this time, and the southern location abandoned. The Conservation Area Appraisal suggests that archaeological excavation might enable this uncertainty to be resolved. Barnhill Farm was established in the early 18th century, and the farmhouse would be incorporated into Guyzance Hall in the 19th century. Park Mill iron and tin foundry was built in 1776, to the designs of John Smeaton, although the main building is known as the Dye House, following its reuse as a woollen mill from 1791. The large house at Brainshaugh was improved by the addition of garden walls, incorporating a privy, and Guyzance Mill was rebuilt by the Duke of Northumberland in the 1830s. The miller continued to live in the 16th-century mill house a little further to the north. The cottages in the main street were remodelled prior to the 1860s, a smithy was added to the west of the dwellings, and one of the cottages became a school in 1852. By the end of the 19th century, access to Guyzance from the south had been improved by the cosntruction of a road heading southwards, which passed Guyzance Mill and crossed the river by a new bridge to the east of the woollen mill. Although the bridge is dated to around 1865, and appeared on the 1897 Ordnance Survey map, it did not appear on the 1895 map. The former track from the hamlet which crossed a ford over Quarry Burn to reach Guyzance Mill became a private road to Barnhill Farm, remodelled to become Guyzance Hall in the 1890s, and a footbridge made crossing the Quarry Burn rather easier. In 1985 the Dye House was extended by the addition of two new bays, and in the late 20th century, cottages 3 and 4 were combined, three cottages opposite them became numbers 7 and 8, two new cottages were added to the north side of the street, some new houses were built near the Dye House, and the school became the village rooms. In 2008, the hamlet of Guyzance became a Conservation Area. Initial assessment was carried out by the North of England Civic Trust on behalf of Alnwick District Council in 2007. Consideration was given to designating a larger area, including Guyzance Bridge, the woollen mill site, the buildings at Brainshaugh and Guyzance Mill, but after consultation, the restricted area immediately around the main street, Barnhill Farm and Guyzance Hall was so designated. The River Coquet and its environs at Guyzance is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which protects it from inappropriate development. The hamlet is part of the Warkworth Ward, and under the governance of Alnwick District Council. No separate population statistics are kept; the population of the ward was 1,960 in 2008, but most of those lived in Warkworth, with only a small number living in Guyzance. The village consists of one small street of single-storey facing cottages, and a number of scattered cottages, farms and large houses. Numbers 1, 2 and 4 are at the east end, on the north side of the street, and form a single terrace. They date from the 18th century, but were remodelled in the 19th century. There was formerly a fourth cottage, No. 3, but this has been incorporated into No. 4, and its front door blocked up. The left hand end wall of No. 4 includes two blind windows and there is a Victorian post box built into it. After two more recent cottages is the old school, which was probably originally a cottage, and is now the village rooms. It also dates from the 18th century, and was remodelled in 1852. Attached to the old school and the final building on the north side of the road is No. 5 and an adjoining former joiners shop, which were built and remodelled at similar times to numbers 1 to 4. Crossing to the south side of the road, No. 6 is opposite the old school, and has a similar history. After a gap, numbers 7 and 8 are opposite numbers 1 to 4. They were originally a row of three cottages, built and remodelled as the same time as the others, but reduced from three to two dwellings in the 20th century. To the rear of No. 8 are some 18th century outbuildings, with attached pigsties, privies and middens, which were altered in the 19th century. The main building contains three blacksmith's windows. All of the buildings and their associated garden walls are grade II listed. Guyzance Hall is a grade II listed structure. It was built as a farmhouse for Barnhill Farm around 1800, but was extended to become a country house in 1894, when the architect William Henry Knowles designed major extensions for the owner J D Milburn. This included a range with a ballroom, built in neo-Tudor style, and the same style was used for a tower added in 1920. The hall, which sits in of land, has 15 bedrooms and was bought by the Rev. Robert Parker in 2008. It became a popular venue for weddings, and Parker sold it for around £6 million in 2016, only retaining a cottage in the grounds for his personal use. The estate has two lodges, and the west lodge, which was built to an "L"–shaped plan in the early 20th century is also grade II listed. It is a single storey building in free Tudor style, although parts of it have a basement. Some to the east is an arched bridge, built of rock-faced stone with cast iron and wrought iron posts and chains. It was constructed at a similar time to the lodge, and carries the drive over Quarry Burn. To the south of the housing are the remains of a chapel. The nave dates from the 11th or 12th centuries, while the chancel dates from the 13th or 14th centuries. The floor of the building is covered with concrete paving added in the 19th century, and there is a memorial to the Tate family dated 1864. There was a Premonstratensian nunnery in the vicinity, founded by Richard Tison in the 12th century, but it had become disused by about 1500, and became a parochial curacy. It is unclear whether the ruins were part of the nunnery or not, as a monastery church and a church of Guyzance are mentioned in early documents, and the ruins could be either. In addition to being grade II* listed, the site is also a scheduled ancient monument. Guyzance Mill, a ruined 19th century water powered corn and feed mill is located on the west bank of the river, with a large dam built across the channel. The iron and timber undershot water wheel is internal to the building, but was probably external when the mill was built. The building has three storeys, and despite its condition, still has some stones, gearing and machinery in position. The present building is not the first on the site, as a mill at this location was documented in 1336, and it may have also been a fulling mill at one point. Some upstream from Guyzance Bridge, and just above the confluence of the Hazon Burn with the River Coquet, is a horseshow dam built by the civil engineer John Smeaton in 1775. His clients were Edward Cook of Brainshaugh and John Archbold of Acton. The downstream face, which is high, is vertical and constucted of squared stone. The curved dam has a radius of and fed a millrace on the south bank of the river. The water powered Acklington Park Iron and Tin Works, but this did not last long, and John Reed converted the building into a woollen mill in 1791. It ceased to be used for this purpose in 1884, and was derelict until 1915, when Ellwood Holmes from Newcastle used it to make hydrate of alumina. It was one of the first factories to be powered by hydroelectricity, after Holmes had a Gilks water turbine fitted into the millrace. This operation was also fairly short-lived, as the Duke of Northumberland refused to renew the lease in 1930 following pollution of the river. The building was converted into flats in 1968. The bridge at the eastern end of the site was built around 1865. It has three segmental arches, constructed of rock-faced stone, and is also grade II listed. On 17 January 1945, ten soldiers drowned while taking part in a military exercise at Guyzance, on the River Coquet. The river was in full flood and their boat was swept over Smeaton's weir, after which it capsized. The men, all aged 18, were weighed down by full combat gear. In 1995, a memorial service was held to mark the 50th anniversary of the tragedy and a plaque was unveiled. The campaign for a memorial had been spearheaded by Burnett Seyburn, who had been a lance corporal at the time of the original tragedy, and Vera Vaggs, a Northumbrian historian. As well as raising money locally, they obtained support from the National Lottery, the War Graves Commission, local landowner Sir Anthony Milburn and the Asda supermarket chain. </doc> <doc id="2343946" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343946" title="WTHI-TV"> WTHI-TV WTHI-TV, virtual and VHF digital channel 10, is a CBS/Fox/MyNetworkTV/CW+-affiliated television station licensed to Terre Haute, Indiana, United States. The station is owned by Heartland Media. WTHI-TV's studios are located on 8th and Ohio Streets in downtown Terre Haute, and its transmitter is located along U.S. 41/U.S. 150 in unincorporated Sullivan County (south of Farmersburg). Master control and some internal operations are housed at the studios of former sister station WISH-TV on North Meridian Street in northwestern Indianapolis. On cable, WTHI-TV is available on Charter Spectrum channel 12 in standard definition and on digital channel 712 in high definition. WTHI-TV first signed on the air on July 22, 1954. It was the first television station in the Terre Haute market. It was founded by local businessman and Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman, owner of radio station WTHI (1480 AM, now WPFR, and 99.9 FM). Channel 10 has been a CBS affiliate since its sign-on; however, it initially carried programming from NBC, ABC and the DuMont Television Network as well through secondary affiliations. WTHI-TV originally operated from a studio facility at 918 Ohio Street (at the intersection of South 9th ½ and Ohio Streets) in downtown Terre Haute, which also became occupied by WTHI-FM upon the television station's sign-on (the building was originally constructed in 1906 to house a garment factory). WTHI lost the DuMont affiliation when the network ceased operations in August 1956; NBC programming moved to the city's second television station, WTWO (channel 2), when it signed on the air in September 1965. The station exclusively aligned with CBS when the ABC affiliation moved to WIIL-TV (channel 38, now WAWV-TV), when it signed on in April 1973. Local programs airing on the station during its earlier history featured Jerry Van Dyke of "Coach" and "My Mother the Car" fame, and "Captain Jack" Hanes, whose most famous guest was eventual Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird. WTHI became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN) when the network launched on January 16, 1995; it carried the network's programming during the overnight hours after CBS's late night programming. The Hulman family continued to own WTHI-TV until 1998, when they sold the station to Emmis Communications. Emmis Communications announced the sale of its 16 television stations on May 15, 2005, in order to concentrate on its radio properties. Emmis sold WTHI-TV to the LIN TV Corporation in August 2005, placing it under common ownership with LIN's three other CBS affiliates in Indiana: WANE-TV in Fort Wayne, WLFI-TV in Lafayette), and at the time, WISH-TV in Indianapolis (the affiliation has since moved to WTTV in January 2015). In October 2012, the station relocated its operations to a new facility located one block west of its original studios, at 800 Ohio Street in downtown Terre Haute; the original studio building, which was also shared with former sister stations WWVR (105.5 FM) (which, along with WTHI-FM, remains owned by Emmis Communications), was demolished in December 2012 to accommodate parking for a new office building being constructed nearby. The move completely separated WTHI-TV from WTHI-FM, which had moved into the new office building that August. On March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would merge with LIN Media in a $1.6 billion deal. The merger was completed on December 19. Shortly thereafter, after an aborted merger plan with Meredith Corporation, Media General announced on January 27, 2016 that it was being acquired by Nexstar Broadcasting Group with the new company named "Nexstar Media Group". As Nexstar already owns WTWO (and operates Mission Broadcasting-owned WAWV-TV) and since the Terre Haute market is too small to allow duopolies in any case, in order to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as planned changes to rules regarding same-market television stations which would prohibit future joint sales agreements, the company was required to sell either WTWO or WTHI to another company. On March 4, 2016, Nexstar and Mission declared their intentions to keep WTWO/WAWV and sell WTHI to another company; on June 13, 2016, it announced that WTHI and four other stations would be acquired by Heartland Media, through its USA Television MidAmerica Holdings joint venture with MSouth Equity Partners, for $115 million. The station's digital signal is multiplexed: WTHI digital subchannel 10.2 originally ran a live 24-hour feed of the station's "Storm Team 10 Fury Radar" system with audio provided by local NOAA Weather Radio station WXK72. On October 25, 2010, the station replaced the radar feed/NOAA audio simulcast with the music video network TheCoolTV as part of an agreement with LIN to carry the network across many of its stations. However, within days of the switch, the station received heavy viewer feedback pillorying the move, suggesting that the radar channel was appreciated; as a result on November 5, 2010, WTHI relaunched the "Fury" radar feed on a new third digital subchannel. On August 25, 2011, it was announced that WTHI had signed affiliation agreements with Fox and MyNetworkTV, which both began broadcasting on WTHI's second digital subchannel on September 1, 2011; WFXW (now WAWV-TV), which had been the market's original Fox affiliate since it switched to the network from ABC in January 1995, rejoined ABC on that date in concurrence with a dispute between management partner Nexstar Broadcasting Group and Fox as well as an affiliation renewal deal with ABC for the company's other affiliates of that network. WTHI-TV became the third LIN Media station to carry major network affiliations on both the main channel and a digital subchannel (LIN-owned NBC affiliate WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan and Fox affiliate WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island, the latter of which is owned by Super Towers, Inc. and operated by LIN, both carry MyNetworkTV on a second digital subchannel). Branded as "MyFox 10", WTHI-DT2 carries Fox primetime programming from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time (7:00 to 9:00 p.m. Central on the Illinois side of the market), while MyNetworkTV programming airs on a three-hour tape delay from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Eastern/10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. Central; WTHI-DT2 became the Terre Haute market's first television outlet for the MyNetworkTV programming service, as it had previously been one of the few markets without a MyNetworkTV affiliate since the service's September 2006 launch. As a result of the dual affiliations, WTHI dropped TheCoolTV (one year before LIN terminated its agreements with the network for its other stations). On the same day that Fox and MyNetworkTV programming began airing on WTHI-DT2, the subchannel debuted a half-hour primetime newscast at 10:00 p.m. Eastern/9:00 p.m. Central. On November 5, 2010, WTHI relaunched the "Fury" radar feed on a new third digital subchannel. To preserve bandwidth for the "MyFox10" subchannel on 10.2, the live feed of "Storm Team 10 Fury Radar" was removed for the second time on August 31, 2011. On December 1, 2015, WTHI relaunched its tertiary subchannel on digital channel 10.3 as an affiliate of Ion Television. On September 6, 2017, WTHI-DT3 switched to a 720p HD feed (branded as "Wabash Valley’s CW10") of The CW's national CW Plus service, succeeding cable-only "WBI" as the CW Plus affiliate for the Terre Haute market; on that date, Ion Television was moved to a newly created subchannel on 10.4. WTHI-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 10, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 24 to VHF channel 10 for post-transition operations. WTHI-TV clears the entire CBS network schedule except for the "CBS Morning News" at 4:30 a.m. However, it airs the "CBS Dream Team" lineup in two blocks – with the first two hours airing on Saturday mornings (leading into the Saturday edition of "CBS This Morning", which itself airs two hours later than most CBS stations that carry the broadcast) and the final hour airing on Sunday mornings. Syndicated programs broadcast by WTHI include "Live with Kelly and Ryan", "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", "Entertainment Tonight", "Family Feud", and "Inside Edition". WTHI-TV presently broadcasts 19½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 3½ hours on weekdays, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays); unlike most CBS affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone, the station's early evening newscast at 5:00 p.m. runs only for a half-hour, with the station opting to fill the 5:30 p.m. half-hour with syndicated programs (currently, the syndicated newsmagazine "Inside Edition"). In addition to its main studios, the station operates a Southern Bureau located at the studios of PBS member station WVUT (channel 22) on North 2nd Street and Rosedale Avenue in Vincennes. Local news programming has been a presence on WTHI since the station's inception. The newscasts were branded during the late 1970s and early 1980s as "NewsCenter 10". The title was changed to "Action 10 News" in 1985, and modified to "Action 10 News WTHI" in 2001. On September 18, 2006, the branding was changed to "News 10", concurrent with the introduction of a new logo and graphics package. WTHI-TV did not air an early evening newscast 5:00 p.m. until September 12, 2011, when WTHI debuted a half-hour newscast in the timeslot – replacing the daytime talk show "Dr. Phil" (which itself moved to NBC affiliate WTWO, after that station moved its hour-long 5:00 p.m. newscast to sister station WAWV-TV, after the former Fox affiliate switched to ABC on September 1). Coinciding with the move to its new facility on Ohio Street on October 20, 2012, beginning with that night's 11:00 p.m. newscast, WTHI became the first commercial television station in the Terre Haute market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. Beginning June 24, 2017, WTHI-TV added the area's first local weekend morning newscast at 8:00 a.m. The newscast airs on both Saturday and Sunday before the CBS News broadcasts. </doc> <doc id="2343949" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343949" title="WTHI"> WTHI WTHI may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2343951" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343951" title="Crypt of the Wizard"> Crypt of the Wizard Crypt of the Wizard is a compilation album by Norwegian solo artist Mortiis, released in 1996.

It may also mean "to take and turn, to shift" as in "the sacred shift within you that is inspired by the healing kahuna..." said twice "lomilomi" for emphasis. Lomilomi practitioners use the palms, forearms, fingers, knuckles, elbows, knees, feet, even sticks and stones. It may be performed with or without emollient. Lomilomi practices vary by family, Ahupuaʻa (traditional region) and island. Traditionally in ancient Hawaii lomilomi was practiced in four contexts: Although the term "kahuna lomilomi" is widely used in contemporary writings, traditionally the people who performed lomilomi were called "ka poe lomilomi" (the massage people) or "kanaka lomi" (massage person). A related term, "kauka lomilomi", was coined in 1920 to describe osteopathic physicians. The word "kauka" is the Hawaiianized version of "doctor". Future practitioners were selected in childhood, around age 5, based on birth signs such as weather events, birthmarks (especially on the head), and kind behavior. After a decade or more of study, they would begin to practice but mastery was believed to take a lifetime. Like all endeavors in old Hawaii, lomilomi was conducted with prayer and intention. Hawaiian kupuna (elder) Auntie Margaret Machado describes lomilomi as "praying" work. Emma Akana Olmstead, a kupuna of Hana, Maui, in the 1930s, said, "When a treatment is to be given, the one who gives the treatment first plucks the herbs to be used. He prays as he picks the herbs. No one should call him back or distract his attention, all should be as still as possible for they do not want the vibration broken. They knew the laws of vibration. They knew the power of the spoken word. They knew Nature. They gathered the vibration of the plentiful." The early Polynesian settlers brought their own form of massage and it evolved to become something uniquely Hawaiian. It was practiced by everyone, from child to chief. As an indigenous practice that evolved over hundreds of years in isolated valleys throughout the island chain, there are many different "schools" of lomilomi with different approaches and techniques. After American missionaries arrived in 1820 and converted many in the Kingdom of Hawaii to Christianity, various laws prohibited "heathen" worship and any related Native Hawaiian healing practices. Lomilomi as part of medical practice went underground. But lomilomi as restorative massage remained popular not only among the Hawaiians, but among foreign residents and visitors as well. Charles Wilkes describes it being offered after his ascent of Mokuaweoweo in 1841 on the United States Exploring Expedition. For Robert Louis Stevenson it was "disagreeable", but English adventurer Isabella Bird found it delightful. Not only did non-Hawaiians receive lomilomi, they also gave it. According to William Brigham the first Director of the Bishop Museum, writing in 1908, one of the most skilled practitioners was Sanford Dole, one of the leaders of the overthrow of the Kingdom. Although the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii banned curing through "superstitious methods" in 1886, massage was not subject to legislation until 1945. In 1947, the Board of Massage was established to regulate lomilomi and massage. The law required practitioners to pass a written test on anatomy, physiology and massage theory. Many renowned native healers were unable or unwilling to pass the test, and thus lomilomi as restorative massage was forced underground. In 2001, the Legislature passed Act 304, amending HRS section 453, allowing native practitioners to be certified by the Hawaiian medical board, Papa Ola Lōkahi, or by the various community health centers. This law is controversial among some native practitioners, but those who are certified (but not licensed) can provide lomilomi without fear of prosecution under Hawaii state law. Many traditionally taught lomilomi practitioners find it virtually impossible to offer authentic lomilomi in a spa setting and are unwilling to work in most spas or massage offices. They prefer to treat selected clients quietly and privately, often in home settings. Lomilomi practitioners may also ask their clients to pray, meditate, change their diets, or take other action as part of their health improvement process. Unlike traditional lomilomi kupuna (elder) recognized by the Hawaiian community who require students to study with them for years, some massage schools around the world purport to train therapists in lomilomi in a few hours and some massage therapists may incorporate techniques from other massage modalities during the session. While often pleasant, this style of massage which is now a common and popular massage modality throughout the world, especially in Hawaii, Japan, Europe and Australia, is very different from authentic lomilomi. </doc> <doc id="2343958" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343958" title="Fryup"> Fryup Fryup () is a hamlet in the North York Moors National Park in North Yorkshire, England. It is within the civil parish of Danby, and is located alongside Great Fryup Beck in Great Fryup Dale. Fryup is separated into two small valleys or "dales": Great Fryup Dale and Little Fryup Dale. The majority of people live in Great Fryup Dale, with Little Fryup having only eight or nine farms and cottages. Great Fryup has no shops nor even a pub; it has a telephone box, a post box, village hall and outdoor centre which used to be the old school. There is also a local cricket pitch and Quoits pitch. The curious name "Fryup" probably derives from the Old English reconstruction *"Frige-hop": "Frige" was an Anglo-Saxon goddess equated with the Old Norse Frigg; "hop" denoted a small valley. An old woman at Fryup was well known locally for keeping the "Mark’s e’en watch" (24 April), as she lived alongside a corpse road known as "Old Hell Road". The practice involved a village seer holding vigil between 11pm and 1am to watch for the wraiths of those who would die in the following 12 months. </doc> <doc id="2343961" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343961" title="Not Like Other Girls"> Not Like Other Girls Not Like Other Girls is the debut album by S.O.A.P.. It was released on 18 March 1998 in Denmark. It was released in the US on 5 May, as a self-titled album on Crave Records, with a European release under Sony held around the same time. Remee wrote the lyrics for the album, which was produced by Holger Lagerfeldt. The album was certified gold in Finland and Denmark, and had sold over 15,000 copies in the US by July 1998. By August 2000, it had sold 1.5 million copies worldwide. The album's debut single was "This Is How We Party". The second single was "Ladidi Ladida", except in the US where the second single released was "Stand By You". "Stand By You" was later recorded by the UK pop group S Club 7 for their album "7". The album won best pop album at the 1999 Danish Music Awards. Remee and Holger Lagerfeldt were also nominated for producer of the year for the album, and "Stand By You" was nominated for best radio hit. </doc> <doc id="2343966" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343966" title="Allen Bristol Aylesworth"> Allen Bristol Aylesworth Sir Allen Bristol Aylesworth, (27 November 1854 – 13 February 1952) was a Canadian lawyer and parliamentarian. Born in Newburgh, Ontario of United Empire Loyalist ancestry, Aylesworth was educated at the University of Toronto, and called to the Ontario Bar in 1878. As the Canadian member of the Alaska Boundary Tribunal in 1903, he presented his country's views in a minority report. Elected to the Dominion parliament in 1905, he served in the cabinet of Sir Wilfrid Laurier as postmaster-general and minister of labour, 1905–1906, and minister of justice, 1906–1911, in which capacity he oversaw the pardon of Angelina Napolitano, Canada's first battered woman defence case. He acted as British representative at the North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration in The Hague, 1910–1911, and was knighted for his services. A Liberal, Aylesworth was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election on 22 November 1905 and re-elected in the 1908 as the Member of Parliament for the riding of York North in the province of Ontario. He served Cabinet of Canada under Sir Wilfrid Laurier as the Minister of Labour and Postmaster General of Canada from 16 October 1905 – 3 June 1906, and as the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada from 4 June 1906 – 6 October 1911. On 11 January 1923 he was appointed to the Senate of Canada upon the recommendation of William Lyon Mackenzie King. He represented the senatorial division of North York, Ontario until his death. Mount Aylesworth, aka Boundary Peak 177, a summit on the Alaska-British Columbia boundary, was named for him in 1927. </doc> <doc id="2343971" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343971" title="WTWO"> WTWO WTWO, virtual channel 2 (UHF digital channel 36), is an NBC-affiliated television station licensed to Terre Haute, Indiana, United States. The station is owned by Nexstar Media Group, which also operates ABC affiliate WAWV-TV (channel 38) under a joint sales agreement with owner Mission Broadcasting. The two stations share studios and transmitter facilities on U.S. 41 in unincorporated Sullivan County (south of Farmersburg). On cable, WTWO is available on Charter Spectrum channel 7 in standard definition and in high definition on digital channel 707. The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1965. Founded by Illiana Telecasting, the first program ever broadcast on WTWO was NBC's morning news program "Today", which aired at 7:00 that morning. WTWO, whose call letters were originally assigned to what is now fellow NBC affiliate WLBZ in Bangor, Maine, from 1954 to 1958, originally operated as a primary NBC affiliate with a secondary affiliation with ABC; it carried ABC network programs either on tape delay or by airing them live from the network feed through occasional preemptions of NBC programs (the most notable preemption being the 1967–1969 science fiction series ""). Eleven days after its sign-on, on September 12, 1965, WTWO began broadcasting network programming in color. Illiana Telecasting sold the station to Booth Newspapers in 1968. ABC programming was split between channel 2 and primary CBS affiliate WTHI-TV (channel 10) until April 1973, when the network moved to upstart WIIL-TV (channel 38, now WAWV-TV, which would eventually drop ABC to join Fox in September 1995 and rejoin ABC in September 2011). In July 1975, Booth Newspapers sold the station to Malcolm Glazer's Fabri Development Corporation. Malcolm Glazer sold WTWO and two of its sister stations WRBL in Columbus, Georgia and KQTV in St. Joseph, Missouri to TCS Television Partners in 1990. TCS Television Partners sold both WTWO and KQTV in St. Joseph to Irving, Texas-based Nexstar Broadcasting Group in 1997. In the spring of 2006, the station dropped on-air references to its channel 2 allocation in its branding, opting to brand simply by the WTWO call letters; the channel 2 branding was restored on October 18, 2010, when it changed its on-air brand to "NBC 2" (concurrent with the introduction of a new logo that was originally used by fellow NBC affiliate WGRZ in Buffalo, New York, from 1998 to 2012). On July 9, 2012, Time Warner Cable replaced Cincinnati NBC affiliate WLWT with WTWO on its systems in southwestern Ohio and northeastern Kentucky, due to a carriage dispute with WLWT owner Hearst Television, that resulted in its stations being pulled from TWC's systems in several markets. Nexstar complained that Time Warner Cable substituted the Hearst stations with its own outside of their market areas without permission, while the provider alleged it was within its rights to carry select Nexstar-owned stations as replacements until it reached a new agreement with Hearst, which Hearst and Time Warner Cable reached on July 19, restoring WLWT on its Cincinnati area systems. The station's digital signal is multiplexed: On June 15, 2016, Nexstar announced that it has entered into an affiliation agreement with Katz Broadcasting for the Escape, Laff, Grit, and Bounce TV networks (the last one of which is owned by Bounce Media LLC, whose COO Jonathan Katz is president/CEO of Katz Broadcasting), bringing the four networks to 81 stations owned and/or operated by Nexstar, including WTWO and WAWV-TV. Subchannels Laff and Escape were off the air from July 25, 2017 to May 15, 2018 due to transmission problems. A temporary antenna had been used to broadcast WTWO and sister station WAWV-TV on 2.1 and 38.1. As of May 15, 2018, the new antenna was installed, and all subchannels returned to the air, including newly available Cozi TV. WTWO discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 36, using PSIP to display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 2. WTWO clears the entire NBC network schedule and airs most programs in pattern, with the exception of the Sunday edition of "Today", which airs two hours later than on most NBC stations (serving as a lead-in to "Meet the Press", due to religious programs that the station airs in the 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. timeslot). Syndicated programs broadcast on WTWO include "Rachael Ray", "Dr. Phil", "Access Live", "Daily Mail TV", "Jeopardy!", and "Wheel of Fortune". In addition, the station produces the half-hour lifestyle program "Good Day Live!". The program originated in the mid-2000s as a Friday midday program titled "The Valley Showcase", before it expanded to include Monday through Thursday editions on December 10, 2007; news and weather segments were added at that point, marking the first time since it cancelled its noon newscast in 2002 that it carried news programming in some form in the midday slot. The Monday through Thursday editions as well as the news and weather segments were dropped in 2009. The program was revamped on May 4, 2012 as "Good Day Live!", and later re-expanded to a five-day-a-week broadcast on September 10, 2012, when it moved from its original 11:00 a.m. timeslot to 4:00 p.m. and added previews of WTWO's evening newscasts and a weather update segment. WTWO made national news in January 2006 when it declined to air the controversial NBC dramedy series "The Book of Daniel", citing calls and emails from viewers objecting to the show's plotline involving Jesus Christ as the rationale for its decision. In a statement on the station's website, then-general manager Duane Lammers stated "our relationship with NBC always provided for the right to reject programming. I am reaffirming that right to let them know I will not allow them to make unilateral decisions affecting our viewers". Due to poor ratings and affiliates in other markets (including Little Rock sister station KARK-TV) also choosing to pre-empt the program, NBC canceled the show after only three episodes (this incident may have served as the basis for a plotline in a 2006 episode of the short-lived NBC drama "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip", in which an NBC affiliate in Terre Haute refused to air the titular comedy series in the show because of a sketch called "Crazy Christians"). WTWO presently broadcasts 14½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 2½ hours on weekdays, and one hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). Unlike most NBC affiliates in the Eastern Time Zone, the station does not produce a midday newscast or an early evening newscast at 5:00 p.m.; this is due to the fact that it produces such programs in those timeslots for sister station WAWV-TV, with channel 2 opting to run syndicated programming during the noon and 5:00 p.m. timeslots. Newscasts on the station began when it debuted on September 1, 1965, under the title "W-2 News". In early 1968, the station rebranded as "TV-2" (while retaining a hyphen for the branding of the station's callsign, rendered as "W-TWO"), its evening newscasts were accordingly renamed "Total News Tonight" (the title was later amended to "Total News at Twelve", when the station added a midday newscast at noon, and to "Total News Today" for the 6:00 p.m. newscast). The "TV-2 News" title was used in conjunction with the "Total News" brand from 1971 until January 1972, when the former became the full-time newscast branding. The station became the first station in the market to begin broadcasting its newscasts in color in 1971, with Johnny Palmer being appointed as anchor of WTWO's evening newscasts (Palmer remained with the station until he retired in 1992). In 1973, the station adopted the "Eyewitness News" format for its news programs, which remained in use by the station until 1994, when its newscasts were renamed "NewsChannel 2" (which was amended to "WTWO NewsChannel 2" after Nexstar bought channel 2 in 1997, and then revised as "WTWO NewsChannel" in 2007). The station debuted an hour-long news and talk program in September 1998, titled "Live at Five". After WTWO entered into a joint sales agreement with Fox affiliate WBAK-TV, WTWO assumed production responsibilities for channel 38's half-hour primetime newscast at 10:00 p.m. on January 1, 2004 from WTHI (which had been producing the program since WBAK became the market's Fox affiliate in 1995), in addition to allowing the station to rebroadcast the 6:00 a.m. hour of channel 2's weekday morning newscast at 7:00 a.m. In May 2007, WTWO began using digital camera equipment for newsgathering purposes. In 2010, the station unveiled a new set for its newscasts, along with a new graphics and music package (using the "Look B" package originally developed by graphics firm NBC ArtWorks for NBC's owned-and-operated stations, along with Stephen Arnold Music's "The Rock" package); the station's news operation was also rebranded as "NBC 2 News". WTWO aired a one-minute promo on 2006 that criticized WTHI's weather coverage, claiming that WTHI's Doppler radar system was inferior to WTWO's because it was located within downtown Terre Haute, resulting in a "dead zone" – the area within the radius of the radar dome where reflectivity cannot be detected – over the city proper, stating that the WTWO radar's "dead zone" was positioned over a corn field and claimed that the combined experience of WTWO's weather staff was more than that of WTHI's staff; it also stated that WTHI's power had multiple points of failure in contrast to WTWO's. The promotion, though technically accurate, became a source of amusement on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" because of its use of hyperbole and techniques reminiscent of political "attack ads". After general manager Duane Lammers called the "Daily Show" "hard-up for material" in a "Tribune-Star" article, host Jon Stewart mocked WTWO further in the following night's opening segment. A response video to "The Daily Show" and Stewart that was supposed to be for internal uses at the station was leaked on YouTube; it has since been taken down, but was uploaded once more on iFilm. When what became WFXW discontinued its Fox affiliation to rejoin ABC as WAWV on September 1, 2011, WTWO moved its 5:00 p.m. newscast to WAWV (at the same time, the 10:00 p.m. newscast was relegated to live streaming broadcast, which was carried on WTWO/WAWV's shared website until it was discontinued on December 28, 2012). WTWO began producing a half-hour midday newscast at noon of channel 38 on September 10, 2012. In addition to handling production of those newscasts, WTWO produces local weather updates seen on WAWV during "AgDay" and "Good Morning America", as well as morning news updates seen the during the latter network morning program. On September 28, 2016, WTWO (along with sister station WAWV) began airing local newscasts in HD with a new set. WTWO also changed the newscast title to "WTWO News", formerly "NBC 2 News". </doc> <doc id="2343976" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343976" title="Robinson list"> Robinson list A Robinson list or Mail Preference Service (MPS) list is an opt-out list of people who do not wish to receive marketing transmissions. The marketing can be via e-mail, postal mail, telephone, or fax. In each case, contact details will be placed on a blacklist. Although the purpose of such a list is to reduce unwanted marketing, the principle that "data is only private until someone decides it isn't" indicates it can also generate unwanted marketing. In the UK, the Mailing Preference Service composes a Robinson list funded by the direct mail industry which collects names and addresses of people who do not want to receive direct marketing. This list is circulated to marketing companies which are then responsible for "not" contacting people on the list. Although use of this list is governed by the Advertising Standards Authority and the Code of Practice of the Direct Marketing Association, there is nonetheless the potential for names on the list to be used for the opposite of their intended purpose, either accidentally or intentionally. </doc> <doc id="2343978" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343978" title="Pacific Strike"> Pacific Strike Pacific Strike is a World War II combat flight simulator video game developed by Origin Systems and released by Electronic Arts for DOS in . The game follows the pattern of the "Wing Commander" series, although it has a greater resemblance to its cousin "Strike Commander" in the sense that it is set in a more or less contemporary setting and allows the player to fly actual planes. The game, just like the above-mentioned titles, mixes aerial simulation with a cinematic plot structured through a series of cutscenes that play between missions. Unlike the above-mentioned titles, "Pacific Strike" was only released in a floppy disk version, while the others were released had CD-ROM versions featuring improved cut-scenes and more digitized speech. Gameplay is very similar to Origin's "Strike Commander". Unlike it or the "Wing Commander" series, "Pacific Strike" immerses the player into a real historical context as an American pilot during the months following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, flying aircraft from a carrier and performing missions like reconnaissance, intercepting enemy planes or attacking enemy vessels. If the player does well it is possible to defeat the Empire of Japan without recourse to the atomic bomb. Extremely poor performance could result in the defeat of the United States Navy and the ceding of Hawaii to the Empire. "Computer Gaming World" rated "Pacific Strike" 1.5 stars out of five. Reporting that Origin apologized on CompuServe for the game's problems, the magazine cited poor performance and mediocre graphics compared to "", and weak sound, and said that the game needed "deep and fundamental changes". </doc> <doc id="2343984" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343984" title="The Lost World: Jurassic Park (console game)"> The Lost World: Jurassic Park (console game) The Lost World: Jurassic Park is an action-adventure video game developed by DreamWorks Interactive and Appaloosa Interactive, and published by Electronic Arts and Sega for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn, respectively, in 1997. "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" is based on the of the same name, which in turn is based on the novel by Michael Crichton. In 1998 a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a Greatest Hits title and featured several modifications to the gameplay. The Saturn and PlayStation versions feature identical gameplay. The game features a side-scroller perspective. There are 5 characters in all throughout the course of the game, each with their own special abilities and attributes: "Compsognathus", Human Hunter, "Velociraptor", "Tyrannosaurus rex", and Sarah Harding, who is also known as the "Human Prey". During gameplay, the character must complete all levels to sequentially gain access to the next character. For each character, there are "DNA bonuses" in each level that can be collected for access to storyboard art for that particular character. Actor Jeff Goldblum briefly reprised his role as Ian Malcolm for a secret ending that the player can access if every DNA bonus is collected. The secret ending is a video of Goldblum congratulating the player for finishing the game, but suggesting to go outside and do other activities instead. "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" ignores the , despite featuring some of its dinosaurs and being set on "Site B", an island also known as Isla Sorna and used as InGen's dinosaur breeding site. The plot varies with every character, each one struggling to survive on the island, populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. The playable dinosaurs' chapters consist of traversing various parts of the island, defending against other predators as well as InGen hunters. The "Human Hunter" chapters are largely based in more urban environments including an underground complex, a geothermal center and an InGen lab. Although objectives are never elaborated on, the Hunter's goal is to eliminate any dinosaur threat. The final chapters involve Harding escaping the island on a cargo ship. DreamWorks Interactive announced that they were working on a video game based on "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" in the third quarter of 1996. In March 1997, Electronic Arts announced that it had secured the distribution and publishing rights for a PlayStation video game adaptation of the film, as part of a deal with DreamWorks. During the first two months of pre-production, producer Patrick Gilmore held daily meetings with his development team to develop a variety of ideas for the game. The ideas were ultimately put into a concept document that included more than 100 pages, some of which offered storyboards and detailed descriptions of each scene in the game. Gilmore said, "The Lost World could have been just another game where you kill dinosaurs, but instead we created an ambiance that enables you to feel what the hunter and the hunted are going through. Too many games hand you a gun and say 'Go shoot' without giving you a feel for what's happening on the other side of the barrel." Concept artist Matt Hall created each of the game's creatures using skeletal references, saying, "I wanted to make sure everything could be backed up by the latest scientific theories regarding posture and musculature. When selecting color, I had much more freedom, but an effort was made to study natural color patterns of animals which exist today." The creatures' designs were based on computer-generated models created for the film by Industrial Light & Magic. Creature designs were also based on photographs of dinosaur maquettes that were created by artist Stan Winston for the film. 3D creatures were then created as low polygon models combined with Hall's sketches. The movements of the game's "T. rex", raptor, and "Brachiosaurus" were based on movements featured in the original film, "Jurassic Park". The game's animation team visited the Los Angeles Zoo multiple times and watched nature programs to study the movement of modern animals as research for how to animate other creatures that did not appear in the films. Animator Sunil Thankamuchy recounted using the physics learned from running to catch the bus with a backpack on to animate the game's Deinonychus, who are known to use their incredibly stiff tail as a rudder when running. Mesh modifiers were applied to create the animations, rather than manipulating the polygonal geometry directly, and a custom development tool was used to convert the animation files into a PlayStation-readable format. Not wanting to divide their resources, Dreamworks opted out of developing the Saturn version, and Sega contracted the job to Appaloosa Interactive. Because the Saturn version was a port, and all major progress on it had to be approved by Dreamworks, it inevitably lagged behind the PlayStation version in development progress. By May 1997, the Sega Saturn version was 40-percent complete, while the PlayStation version was 60-percent complete and approximately three weeks ahead in development. The game was created with DreamWorks Interactive's Morf-X game engine. Though the engine supports true 3D worlds, the team decided to use 2D gameplay since it involves simpler controls and camera work, allowing for more intense action and greater ease in setting up cinematic shots. The development team had access to pre-production materials from the film, as well as models and sets. Spielberg regularly checked on the progress of the game, and also offered creative input. Spielberg was particularly helpful in providing technical information about dinosaurs to the developers. Bryan Franklin and Erik Kraber of Franklin Media worked on the game's sound effects; they had previously created sound effects for "Jurassic Park: The Online Adventure" and . The creature sound effects were created using thousands of animal noises, such as beluga whale songs, vermilion flycatcher clicks, and the grunts of baby jaguars, as well as humans blowing through a 12-foot vacuum tube. A total of 1,400 sounds were created for the game's 23 creatures and two human characters, as well as other elements of the game. Sound effects were altered in multiple ways to create the creatures' various noises. The music was composed by Michael Giacchino who was hired by DreamWorks Interactive to create a synth score to show to the game's producer Steven Spielberg. Spielberg was impressed by his music and to the surprise of everyone involved he assumed it would be fully orchestrated. Giacchino was given a book of the game's storyboards to aid in the musical composition. Giacchino worked on the score for six months while the game was in development. The music was created during a two-day recording session with a 40-piece orchestra, and was subsequently mixed at a post-production house in Hollywood, California. The soundtrack was edited to include 19 tracks, with a total duration of 45 minutes. Giacchino gave each playable character a brief theme to reflect their personality and purpose. After hearing the soundtrack, Spielberg called Giacchino "a young John Williams." Reviewers expressed so much enthusiasm for playing a game with a live orchestral soundtrack that DreamWorks would get Giacchino to use an orchestra for his later scores for the "Medal of Honor" games. The soundtrack can be played by inserting the game disc into a CD player. "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" soundtrack was released separately on CD by Sonic Images on February 24, 1998. "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" was released to mixed reviews, it currently holds a score of 59.67% on GameRankings. Multiple critics noted that the game suffered from poor control, incredibly high difficulty, and a lack of a save function. Additionally, GameSpot commented regarding the T. rex as a playable character, "on the back of the game's box it says in really big letters: "You're The T-Rex." The whole truth is you only get to be the T-Rex for seven of the 30 levels." Despite the negative reviews there were a number of elements in the game that received praise. The orchestral soundtrack was noted by critics as a high point in the game. The sound design was also well received, with GameSpot even stating that it was "definitely one of the few reasons you will enjoy playing The Lost World". Many also agreed that the in-game graphics were some of the best available upon its release. The dinosaurs in particular were considered to be highly lifelike with Game Revolution stating that "despite the game's many problems, every PlayStation owner should rent the game just to experience its graphics". Lee Nutter of "Sega Saturn Magazine" gave the Saturn version a 60 percent rating out of 100 and criticized its poor controls, bad graphics, and difficulty of certain levels, but praised its orchestral soundtrack as "one of the very few redeeming features" of the game. On September 23, 1998, the game was released for the Sony PlayStation under the Greatest Hits banner as "The Lost World: Jurassic Park - Special Edition". Unlike most greatest hits releases this was not a straight repackaging of the original game. Instead the Special Edition featured several modifications to the gameplay designed to address concerns raised by critics on the games initial release. Several of the game's mechanics that were modified included the difficulty level with mid level checkpoints, stronger player characters, and the inclusion of level select codes in the manual. The Special Edition also featured an additional level that allowed players to play as the "T. rex" much earlier than before. A number of other games were released under the title "The Lost World: Jurassic Park "for other systems, as well as an arcade game and a pinball game. These games were developed separately by different companies and featured completely different gameplay styles. </doc> <doc id="2343997" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2343997" title="William Beauclerk, 10th Duke of St Albans"> William Beauclerk, 10th Duke of St Albans William Amelius Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, 10th Duke of St Albans, PC DL (15 April 1840 – 10 May 1898), styled Earl of Burford until 1849, was a British Liberal parliamentarian of the Victorian era. The Duke served in William Gladstone's government as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard between 1868 and 1874. St Albans was the only son of William Beauclerk, 9th Duke of St Albans, and Elizabeth Catherine, daughter of Major General Joseph Gubbins. On 13 June 1863, he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Nottinghamshire (Robin Hood) Rifle Volunteer Corps. St Albans succeeded his father in the dukedom in 1849, aged nine. He later took his seat on the Liberal benches in the House of Lords and served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard from 1868 to 1874 in William Ewart Gladstone's first administration. In 1869 he was sworn of the Privy Council, but never returned to active political office, although he accepted appointment as Lord-Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire serving between 1880 and 1898. St Albans was twice married: His Grace married, firstly, Sybil Mary Grey (28 November 1848 – 7 September 1871, London), daughter of Lt.-Gen. The Hon. Sir Charles Grey and granddaughter of Charles, 2nd Earl Grey, on 20 June 1867 in London. They had three children: After the early death of his first wife, he married, secondly, Grace Bernal-Osborne (26 July 1848, Newtown Anner, Tipperary - 18 November 1926, London), on 3 January 1874 in County Tipperary. She was the granddaughter of London Sephardic Jewish Shakespearian actor turned parliamentarian Ralph Bernal. Her father Ralph Bernal Jr., later Ralph Bernal Osborne, was Secretary of the Admiralty and a parliamentarian. Grace's mother was an Osborne, an Anglo-Irish landed family; they had five children: The Duke of St Albans died in May 1898, aged 58, and was succeeded in the dukedom by the only son from his first marriage, Charles, who in turn was succeeded by his younger half-brother Osborne. </doc> <doc id="2344002" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344002" title="WVUT"> WVUT WVUT, virtual and UHF digital channel 22, is a PBS member television station located in Vincennes, Indiana, United States. The station is owned by Vincennes University. WVUT maintains studio facilities located on North 2nd Street and Rosedale Avenue in Vincennes, and its transmitter is located along U.S. 41/U.S. 150 in unincorporated Sullivan County (south of Farmersburg). The station's history traces back to the launch of a television station in Princeton, WRAY-TV (channel 52), a commercial independent station that signed on in October 1959; it was co-owned with radio station WRAY (1250 AM), which shared studio space with WRAY-TV. With competition from two television stations – WTVW and WFIE-TV – out of the nearby Evansville market, WRAY-TV was never successful and ceased operations. The station's studio equipment was donated to Vincennes University; however, the license itself was surrendered to the Federal Communications Commission in February 1961. By the time that Vicennes University applied for a new station license, the old channel 52 allocation had been reassigned to UHF channel 34, and the construction permit originally issued on February 8, 1966 was re-issued under that allocation, only to be changed by the FCC to channel 22 a few weeks later as part of a nationwide shuffling of channel allocations for stations that had not yet been built. WVUT first signed on the air on February 15, 1968, as a member station of National Educational Television (NET). WVUT joined PBS when the reorganized network launched on October 5, 1970. The station's digital signal is multiplexed: WVUT discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 52, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 22 for post-transition operations. Local programming on WVUT includes a student-produced newscast, titled "NewsCenter 22", which airs during Vincennes University's fall, winter and spring semesters, as well as the weekly public affairs program "22 Magazine". </doc> <doc id="2344003" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344003" title="Miracle (S.O.A.P. album)"> Miracle (S.O.A.P. album) Miracle is the second and final album by S.O.A.P..

In 1987, stand-up comedian Ron Bennington joined radio veteran Ron Diaz to create the wildly popular radio program, "The Ron & Ron Show", at Tampa Bay's WYNF-FM, known as 95YNF. The show had huge ratings success and Ron & Ron known as "Radio's Bad Boys" then partnered with their agent Ross Reback to form The Ron & Ron Radio Network to own and syndicate the programming. The show's final broadcast for WYNF was on March 12, 1993. Reback became President and CEO of the newly formed network and quickly negotiated a deal to broadcast the show in Miami, FL, Orlando, FL, and Jacksonville, FL with another dozen markets soon following (including a new more lucrative deal in Tampa, FL). Ron Diaz announced his departure on-air from "The Ron & Ron Show" in early 1997, and on September 29, 1997 after a successful 11-year run the show ended. Ross Reback successfully negotiated a divestiture of The Ron & Ron Radio Network through a sale to Paxson Communications Corp.[8] Ron Diaz announced his departure on-air from The Ron & Ron Show in early 1997[9] as Paxson prepared to relocate it from the network’s studios in St. Petersburg, FL to one in Hollywood, FL. Without Diaz, and under Paxson, the show soon floundered, and on September 29, 1997 after a successful 11-year run (the last few months of which featured several replacement hosts, all of whom took the name "Ron" in a failed attempted replacement of Diaz). Due to low ratings after Diaz's departure, The Ron & Ron Show was promptly canceled when Clear Channel Radio purchased the radio division of rightsholder, Paxson Communications, and opted not to continue the show. Ron Diaz announced his departure from "The Ron & Ron Show" on-air in 1997. A short time later, Diaz joined Clear Channel Radio's Classic Rock station WTBT-FM (Thunder 103.5) and launched the brand new "The Ron Diaz Show," as the station launched its dial position on 103.5. Ron Diaz was partnered with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers player Ian Beckles for 12 years as the host of "The Ron & Ian Show" on WDAE (620 AM and 95.3 FM) in Tampa, FL. Beckles' contract was not renewed by the station, and he departed the show in December 2015. As of January 2016, Ron Diaz is currently the host of "The Ron & JP Show" on WDAE (620 AM and 95.3 FM) in Tampa, FL with JP Peterson. Peterson is the former Sports Director of WFLA-TV Newschannel 8 in Tampa. On December 21, 1994 Ron Diaz announced that his wife Debbie was diagnosed with AIDS and Diaz began periodically missing broadcasts to care for her. Debbie Diaz died on November 13, 1995. </doc> <doc id="2344012" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344012" title="Immigrant Song"> Immigrant Song "Immigrant Song" is a 1970 song by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is built upon a repeating riff and features lyrical references to Norse mythology, with singer Robert Plant's howling vocals mentioning war-making and Valhalla. The song was included on their third studio album, "Led Zeppelin III" and released as a single. Several live recordings have also been issued on various Led Zeppelin albums. Other artists have recorded renditions of the song or performed it live. Though Led Zeppelin is regarded as an album-oriented group, "Immigrant Song" is one of the band's several hit singles and appeared on singles charts in several countries. The song's popularity has led to its inclusion in such compilation albums as "Led Zeppelin Remasters" (1990) and "Early Days: The Best of Led Zeppelin, Vol. 1" (1999). "Immigrant Song" was written during Led Zeppelin's tour of Iceland, Bath and Germany in the summer of 1970. The opening date of this tour took place in Reykjavík, Iceland, which inspired Plant to write the lyrics. He explained in an interview: Six days after Led Zeppelin's appearance in Reykjavik, the band performed the song for the first time in concert during the Bath Festival. The song begins with a distinctive, wailing cry from Plant and is built on a repeating, staccato riff by guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. It is performed in the key of F minor at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute. There is a very faint count-off at the beginning of the track with lots of hiss which appears on the album version, but is trimmed from the single version. The hiss is feedback from an echo unit. A phrase from the song was used as the title of Stephen Davis' biography of the band, "Hammer of the Gods: The Led Zeppelin Saga". The lyrics also did much to inspire the classic heavy metal myth, of Viking-esque figures on an adventure, themes which have been adopted in the look and music of bands such as Iron Maiden, Saxon, Manowar and Amon Amarth. "Immigrant Song" is one of Led Zeppelin's few releases on the 45 rpm single format. It was issued in the United States on 5 November 1970 by Atlantic Records and reached number 16 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. First pressings of the US single have a quote from Aleister Crowley inscribed in dead wax by the run-out groove: "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." The Japanese single included "Out on the Tiles" as the B-side. In a contemporary review of "Led Zeppelin III", Lester Bangs of "Rolling Stone" described "Immigrant Song" as the closest to being as classic as "Whole Lotta Love", praising the song's "bulldozer rhythms and Plant's double-tracked wordless vocal crossings echoing behind the main vocal like some cannibal chorus wailing in the infernal light of a savage fertility rite." "Immigrant Song" was used to open Led Zeppelin concerts from 1970 to 1972. On the second half of their 1972 concert tour of the United States, it was introduced by a short piece of music known as "LA Drone", designed to heighten the sense of anticipation and expectation amongst the concert audience. By 1973, "Immigrant Song" was occasionally being used as an encore, but was then removed from their live set. Live versions of the song can be heard on the Led Zeppelin albums "How the West Was Won" (featuring a performance at Long Beach Arena in 1972) and the "Led Zeppelin BBC Sessions" (a version from the Paris Theatre in London in 1971). When the song was played live, Page included a lengthy guitar solo, which was absent on the recorded "Led Zeppelin III" version. "Immigrant Song" was played as part of the 2009 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony for Jeff Beck by both Page and Beck.

The frame is usually made of wood, metal or plastic. There are many types of drying racks, including large, stationary outdoor racks, smaller, folding portable racks, and wall-mounted drying racks. A drying rack is similar in usage and function to a clothes line, and used as an alternative to the powered clothes dryer. A pulley clothes airer can be loaded and unloaded at a convenient height, and hoisted out of the way to ceiling height while the clothes dry. The racks are also used in kitchens, to hang utensils out of the way. A pulley clothes airer is sometimes also described as "Victorian", "Edwardian", or "Lancashire" and then comprises two iron frames positioned as far apart as desired to provide a suitable length, with wooden laths, typically four or six, passed through holes in them. The frames are suspended from the ceiling by a system of rope and pulleys. The result is a hoistable rack with several parallel bars on which clothes can be draped out of the way, or hung, extending further down, with clothes hangers. A modern development uses a wooden frame with seven to eleven continuous clothes lines which increase the capacity of the clothes horse. The frame uses a clam cleat to tighten the clothes lines and hangs on four ropes. This increases the necessary installation effort, but also improves safety by increasing redundancy of the suspension. It uses a pulley system (block and tackle) which reduces the required force to lift the loaded frame. Used figuratively, the single-word term "clotheshorse" describes men and women who are passionate about clothing and always appear in public dressed in the latest styles. From 1850 the term referred to a male fop or female quaintrelle, a person whose main function is, or appears to be, to wear or show off clothes. In this context, the term is similar to "fashion plate," which originally referred to a lithograph illustration of fashionable clothing in a book or magazine. </doc> <doc id="2344019" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344019" title="Wake Up Call (2002 TV program)"> Wake Up Call (2002 TV program) Wake Up Call is an American television business news program that aired on CNBC in the early morning.

Walter Ford Gormly was born February 7, 1915, the middle son of Will J. and Anna L. Gormly of Mount Vernon, Iowa. After transferring from Colorado State College, he received his B.S. (1939) from Iowa State College (University) in Mechanical Engineering. While a student, Gormly was active in the Collegiate Presbyterian Church and the local chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). Because he was a conscientious objector, and because he refused to serve in government-sanctioned work camps, Gormly was incarcerated for three years during World War II in the federal prison at Sandstone, Minnesota. While in prison he staged a hunger strike, which lasted for four months and four days (during which time he was fed intravenously) before he was freed without parole. Gormly, believing that federal tax dollars funded the military, continued his anti-war activities by refusing to pay federal income tax during the 1950s. In 1962, he staged another hunger strike in front of the Internal Revenue Service building in Des Moines, Iowa, and was once again jailed for a short time. During this period, Gormly also became very interested in food and drug issues and was a vocal opponent of fluoride. He published "Newsman's Gadfly" during the 1960s and authored a column, "Voice from the Woods". He was a member of the Society for Social Responsibility in Science (SSRS) and the Humanists of Iowa.

Creators Chuck Austen and Olivier Coipel first featured her in "Avengers" #77-81 (March–June 2004); in the story she sacrifices her life to protect Captain America, only to be resurrected as the new Captain Britain, but with the condition that she does not reveal her identity to her children. She went on to appear in Austen and Scott Kolins' "Avengers" #82-84 (July–August 2004) and Austen, Allan Jacobsen and C.P. Smith's "New Invaders" #0 (August 2004); in a story-line which begins with her getting angry at her own funeral causing her new teammates to begin to suspect her true identity. She made a brief supporting appearance in Brian Michael Bendis and David Finch's "The Avengers" #500-501 (September–October 2004); in which she is hospitalized in critical condition following the initial battle. Bendis and Michael Gaydos concluded her run in the "Avengers" with a brief appearance in "Avengers Finale" (January 2005); in which she announces her intention to return home. Kelsey Leigh was a single mother with two young children who lived in South-East England. She was a schoolteacher who taught English literature and history. Back when she was married, thugs invaded her home, robbing her family and gang-raping her. She fought back, hurting one of her rapists, and he cut her face with a broken bottle in revenge, scarring her permanently. Meanwhile, her husband, Richard, was too paralyzed with fear to help her. His guilt over that incident led to the dissolution of the marriage. One fateful day, her family found themselves on the front line of a battle between the Avengers and the Wrecking Crew. Thunderball rendered Captain America unconscious and Kelsey selflessly put herself between the fallen Captain and the Wasp and their attacker, using the downed hero's shield. While the shield was indestructible, Kelsey wasn't, and the shock from the blows inflicted terrible injuries; she died en route to receiving medical attention. Kelsey awoke to find herself in a ring of standing stones, where she was met by a vision of Brian Braddock (Captain Britain), currently ruling Otherworld, and his wife, the elemental shapeshifter Meggan. To save Britain from the evil Morgan le Fay, he passed the mantle of Captain Britain to Kelsey. Her heroic act of bravery had earned her a second chance to live and to defend her home. As was Braddock before her; Kelsey was given the choice between the Sword of Might and the Amulet of Right. However, unlike when Braddock made that choice, Kelsey was only presented with the choice between sword or amulet, and she was not informed of their symbolic importance. Kelsey, desperate to see her children again, and not seeing how a necklace could defend anything, chose the sword, the path of violence. Instantly, she was transformed into the new Captain Britain, only to discover that her decision meant that if she ever revealed who she was to her children, it would cost their lives. The new Captain Britain returned to Earth, where she helped the Avengers defeat Morgan and her cronies, proving herself to be far more ruthless in battle than her predecessor, apparently killing Thunderball when she impaled him on her blade. With her children now in the Avengers' care, Kelsey accepted an offer to join the team, so that even if she could not be reunited with them, she could remain close and in their lives. Kelsey remained a member of the Avengers until the events of "Avengers Disassembled". When She-Hulk went crazy after an attack by Ultron robots, Kelsey stepped up, once again putting herself in the path of danger to rescue the fallen Captain America. She-Hulk knocked her out, and she spent the remainder of the unfolding events in hospital, her status critical. In "Avengers Finale", Kelsey left the disbanding Avengers, returning home to England fully recovered. Going under the codename of Lionheart, Kelsey seeks revenge and blames Captain Britain for what happened to her; for not warning her of the consequences of choosing the Sword of Might and for losing her children. Though unknown how it occurred, Lionheart was manipulated by Albion, a supervillain who also dislikes Captain Britain. Lionheart, though struggling to fight her conscience, would have killed Courtney Ross, the woman who shares his heart and must thus share his fate, if not for the arrival of Juggernaut and Nocturne. After a fight between Albion and Captain Britain, Lionheart and Albion fled. Albion returns with an army of Shadow Captains and Lionheart at his side. Using a mystical device, he neutralises all forms of modern technology, plunging Britain into a pre-industrial state. The effect is catastrophic. They join forces with Shadow-X and soon after Sage joins Albion's ranks undercover as Diana Fox — code-named Britannia — Kelsey sees the error of her ways. She joins forces with Excalibur and helps defeat Albion and his Shadow Captains, restoring Britain to its former state. In acknowledgment of her help against Albion, the Government gives her a second chance working with them. Braddock suggests that it is time to set things right with her family and she is reunited with her children and mother. Pete Wisdom tells them that her disappearance was due to working for the Crown, working on a secret mission in the months since her "death". Lionheart possesses super strength, speed, stamina, reflexes and reactions, endurance, senses, and flight. The Sword of Might gives her the ability to form energy blasts or shields. </doc> <doc id="2344028" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344028" title="Street Signs (TV program)"> Street Signs (TV program) Street Signs is a television business program that originally aired on CNBC, and currently airs on CNBC Asia and CNBC Europe. Before the Asian version debuted on March 31, 2014 (see "CNBC Asia" further down this page for more information), it was broadcast on CNBC at 2:00pm ET. The CNBC United States version's final episode aired on February 6, 2015, due to "Power Lunch" returning to a two-hour format. The European version of "Street Signs", which is aired in a one-hour format on CNBC Europe, debuted January 4, 2016 (see "CNBC Europe" further down this page for more information). This program focuses on the day's market action. In addition, prominent analysts, investors and executives regularly appear on the program to offer their perspective. "Street Signs" was originally a two-hour programme that aired on CNBC from 1996 to February 1, 2002. It was cancelled effective February 4, 2002 and "Power Lunch" occupied its vacated slot as a result of CNBC's revamped programming line-up. On December 8, 2003, former "Business Center" co-anchor and original host Ron Insana revived "Street Signs". And in March 2006, "Squawk on the Street" co-anchor Erin Burnett replaced Insana as the programme's new host. Burnett left CNBC on May 6, 2011. After Erin Burnett's departure Amanda Drury (late of CNBC Asia) and Brian Sullivan (late of the Fox Business Network) became this program's new anchor team and were to be the show's final anchors. On October 13, 2014, "Street Signs" was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox presentation. One notable segment of the programme, which aired at 2:40pm ET, the "Stop Trading!" segment, was presented by Jim Cramer (host of another CNBC program, "Mad Money"). In this segment, which formerly aired on "Closing Bell" prior to 2006-09-11, the co-anchors asked Cramer about the stocks making news, and also asked him for his take on the day's markets. After the segment, a full-screen disclaimer was shown as "Street Signs" go to a commercial break. Cramer's "Stop Trading!" segment was moved to the end of the first hour of "Squawk on the Street" on February 9, 2015. Jim Cramer's on-air tirade about the weakening economy, which was seen during the "Stop Trading!" segment of this program on 2007-08-03, garnered widespread attention and helped galvanise the Federal Reserve Board to cut interest rates. As of January 4, 2016, the European version of "Street Signs" is the only CNBC Europe program that is aired on CNBC's United States channel. Coincidentally (as previously mentioned), CNBC's own version of "Street Signs" aired its last show 11 months earlier, on February 6, 2015. CNBC Asia's version of "Street Signs" debuted March 31, 2014, with Martin Soong and Oriel Morrison as co-anchors. Soong was previously a longtime co-anchor of "Asia Squawk Box" and Morrison was anchor of the now-cancelled "Cash Flow". The background music for both the Asian and European versions is the same as CNBC Asia's "The Rundown" and CNBC United States' "Squawk Alley". This programme originally aired in a two-hour format until October 29, 2018, when it was expanded to three hours (9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m. SIN/HK) due to the cancellation of "The Rundown". CNBC Europe's version of "Street Signs" debuted January 4, 2016. Airing in a one-hour format from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. CET, it replaced the first hour of "Worldwide Exchange", which itself had its airtime halved to one hour. However, the programme is occasionally extended to two hours on American bank holidays. The CNBC Europe version of "Street Signs" was originally co-anchored by Louisa Bojesen and Carolin Roth. Bojesen was previously anchor of the now-cancelled "European Closing Bell" and Roth, who became the solo anchor of "Street Signs" following Bojesen's departure from CNBC Europe on April 28, 2017, was previously co-anchor of "Worldwide Exchange". "Street Signs" is also broadcast on CNBC's United States channel from 4:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. ET. </doc> <doc id="2344032" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344032" title="Cybele asteroid"> Cybele asteroid Cybele asteroids (also known as the "Cybeles") are a dynamical group of asteroids, named after the asteroid 65 Cybele. Considered by some as the last outpost of an extended asteroid belt, the group consists of more than a thousand members and a few collisional families. The Cybeles are in a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. Their orbit is defined by an osculating semi-major axis of 3.28 to 3.70 AU, with an eccentricity of less than 0.3, and an inclination less than 25°. The dynamical Cybele group is located adjacent to the outermost asteroid belt, beyond the Hecuba gap – the 2:1 resonant zone with Jupiter, where the Griqua asteroids are located – and inside the orbital region of the Hilda asteroids (3:2 resonance), which are themselves followed by the Jupiter trojans (1:1 resonance) further out. Three known asteroid families exist within the Cybele group: the Sylvia family (603), the Huberta family and the Ulla family (903). A potential fourth family is a small cluster with the parent body . A fifth family, named after 522 Helga, was identified in 2015. The Cybele asteroids 87 Sylvia and 107 Camilla are triple systems with more than one satellite. Other large members include 121 Hermione, 76 Freia, 790 Pretoria, and 566 Stereoskopia. The group is thought to have formed from the breakup of a larger object in the distant past. While most members are C- and X-type asteroids, NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer also measured albedos of some Cybele asteroids that are typical for stony S-type asteroids. Total of 1978 Cybeles with osculating semi-major axis between 3.28 and 3.7 AU. Low numbered members of the collisional Sylvia (SYL) and smaller Ulla (ULA) families are also marked. </doc> <doc id="2344033" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344033" title="Jim Traynor"> Jim Traynor James Traynor (born 27 September 1953) is a Scottish former sports journalist and Director of Communications at Rangers F.C.

In doubles mode, the player and a human teammate can face the CPU, said-players can each pair with a CPU opponent, or one player can pair with a CPU opponent to face two other computer opponents. Circuit mode is the most unlike the other modes and featuring a wide range of sequential tours the player can choose to battle through each to earn ranking points, with aim to finish number one in the rankings. There are four minor tournaments and four major tournaments, each taking place on one of three surfaces that each have different effects on how the ball bounces; the tournaments are based on real-life counterparts and include nearly every world tournament in existence at that current time. All tennis players, whether playable or the opponents, are cute, short representations of the then-top world players, though their last names are left out of the game. Each playable tennis player has their own talents on the court. Multiple of the right-hand buttons of the SNES controller perform different tennis racket moves and the direction of the ball when hit is influenced by the control pad, which also moves the player around their side of the tennis court in anticipation of the ball. "Super Tennis" takes time to master, as the game neither tells the player how to play, nor gives them any knowledge on how the many different playable characters subtly differ in play style. The version of "Super Tennis" released for the United Kingdom was critically acclaimed. Mean Machines magazine declared it to be "the best tennis game available [as of October 1991]" and scored all aspects of the game very highly, from sound, to gameplay, to their overall impressions. They were impressed by the attention to detail, like how ball runners get the ball off of the court whenever it gets caught in the net. Computer & Video Games' editor said that "Super Tennis" is "more fun than should be allowed" when a set is played against a friend. They also echoed the declaration that this was the best tennis game available up until that point. In a retrospective, Mean Machines' then editor stated that the game was both "the best representation of the sport to date" and also the most "fantastically competitive," but also said the single player was "nothing special." </doc> <doc id="2344035" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344035" title="University of Michigan Library"> University of Michigan Library The University of Michigan Library is the university library system of the University of Michigan, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in the United States. The University of Michigan Library ranks as the sixth largest library in the United States. As of 2014–15, the University Library contained more than 12.8 million volumes, while all campus library systems combined held more than 13.8 million volumes. The Library also held 136,810 current serials, and over 4.42 million annual visits. Founded in 1838, the University Library is the university's main library and is housed in 12 buildings, with more than 20 libraries, among the most significant of which are the Shapiro Undergraduate Library, Hatcher Graduate Library, Special Collections Library, and Taubman Health Sciences Library. However, several U-M libraries are independent of the University Library: the Bentley Historical Library, the William L. Clements Library, the Gerald R. Ford Library, the Kresge Business Administration Library of the Ross School of Business, and the Law Library of the University of Michigan Law School. The University Library is also separate from the libraries of the University of Michigan–Dearborn (Mardigian Library) and the University of Michigan–Flint (Frances Willson Thompson Library and Genesee Historical Collections Center). UM was the original home of the JSTOR database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics. In December 2004, the University of Michigan announced a book digitization program in collaboration with Google (known as Michigan Digitization Project), which is both revolutionary and controversial. Books scanned by Google are included in HathiTrust, a digital library created by a partnership of major research institutions. As of March 2014, the following collections had been digitized: Art, Architecture and Engineering Library; Bentley Historical Library; Buhr Remote Shelving Facility (large portions; Dentistry Library (portions); Fine Arts Library (large portions); Hatcher Graduate Library (large portions); Herbarium Library;Kresge Business Administration Library; Law Library (portions); Museums Library; Music Library (large portions); Shapiro Science Library (large portions); Shapiro Undergraduate Library (large portions); Social Work Library; Special Collections Library (portions); Taubman Health Sciences Library (large portions); Responding to restricted public funding and the rising costs of print materials, the Library has launched significant new ventures that use digital technology to provide cost-effective and permanent alternatives to traditional print publication. The University Library is also an educational organization in its own right, offering a full range of courses, resources, support, and training for students, faculty, and researchers. The University Librarian and Dean of Libraries is James Hilton, whose term began on September 1, 2013. The Michigan Legislature created the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1838, and that year allocated funding for a library. The next year (three years before classes began), the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan acquired the University Library's first volume, John James Audubon's "Birds of America", purchased at a cost of $970. (The book is now displayed in the Library Gallery's Audubon Room). Also in 1838, the university's first professor, Asa Gray (known as the "father of American botany"), was entrusted with a $5,000 budget to establish the first collection of books for the University Library; he purchased 3,400 volumes. Before the university's first years, books were stored in various places around campus, including at the Law School and in various professors' homes. In 1856, the North Wing of the University Building was remodeled, and books centralized in the University's Library and Museum there. In 1863, the Library moved to the Law Building. In 1883, with Raymond Cazallis Davis (chief librarian) as a motivating force in it accomplishment, the university's first library building was completed. Within twelve years of its construction the building was already too small for the growing collection. Between 1870 and 1940 the collection grew rapidly, from 17,000 to 941,500. In 1890, the University Library inaugurated a handwritten card catalog system, which later changed to typed cards and, after 1900, to printed cards from the Library of Congress. By 1895, the Library's overcrowding problem had become acute, and President James Burrill Angell told the Regents that "The embarrassment, to which I have called attention in previous reports, arising from the crowded condition of the Library, of course grows more serious every year." In 1900, the library established "caged areas in the stacks to protect books of exceptional value," becoming one of the first rare book rooms to be established in America. By 1905, student borrowing privileges had become established, a shift from the early restricted-circulation model in which students needed a faculty member's permission to check books out of the Library. In 1911, the Detroit anarchist Joseph Labadie donated his personal library to the university, establishing the nucleus of what became of the Labadie Collection, the oldest collection of radical-left history materials in the world. By 1915, the overcrowded, wood-constructed General Library was designated a fire hazard by the Board of Regents. After this, a new building was finally constructed. Designed by architect Albert Kahn, the library building (which is today the north building of the Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library) was dedicated on January 7, 1920. The same year, Professor Francis W. Kelsey (who founded the university's Kelsey Museum of Archaeology) added 617 ancient Egyptian papyri to the university's holdings, beginning the University of Michigan Papyrus Collection, which became the largest in the Americas. By 1940, the University Library's card catalog has 2,000 trays and 1.75 million cards. A post-World War II boom in enrollment, fueled by the G.I. Bill, further strained the Library's crowding problems as the library continued to expand. In 1947, the Library took over collection development responsibilities, replacing the old system in which each academic department selected and purchases books and journals. In 1948, the Library established its Far Eastern Library (renamed the Asia Library in 1959) of materials from China, Japan, and Korea; the Asian Library is now the largest collection of East Asian resources in North America. In 1970, an eight-story addition was built, where much of the print collections are housed, along with the Library's administration offices, the Map Library, Special Collections, and Papyrology. In 1959 the Shapiro Undergraduate Library was built, with a policy of open access to the stacks for students. In years to come the principle of access to materials would become the standard and goal for all libraries and initiatives. The Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library is the university's primary research collection for the humanities and social sciences. It contains over 3.5 million volumes and over 10,000 periodicals written in more than 300 languages. Commonly cited collecting strengths of the Graduate Library include English and French history, papyrology, Germanic history and culture, classical archeology, military history, English Literature, social and political movements. In addition, these general stacks collections are supported by strong holdings in United States and foreign government documents, a significant collection of maps and cartographic materials, a comprehensive collection of publications written in East Asian languages, manuscripts and special collections, over 1.5 million items in microformat, and a strong collection of reference and bibliographic sources. A number of units are physically in the Hatcher Library or are organizationally associated with the Hatcher Library. These include: Click here for an audio walking tour of the Graduate Library. Asia Library: The Asia Library is located on the fourth floor of Hatcher Graduate Library (North). It is one of the largest collections of East Asian materials in North America, as of June 2012 holds some 785,000 volumes of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean monographs, 2,100 currently received serials, and 80,000 titles of materials in microform, and a large number of electronic resources in all East Asian languages. The Asia Library also has a reference room with essential reference materials, such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, maps, bibliographies, and indexes, in both East Asian and Western languages. The Asia Library launched its own website in April 1994, making it one of the first multilingual websites on East Asian studies. Stephen S. Clark Library: The Clark Library is the university's combined "map collection, government information center, and spatial and numeric data services" center. Its map collection is the largest in Michigan and one of the largest of any university, consisting of more than 370,000 maps and about 10,000 atlases and reference works. The map collection's holdings include a variety of cartographic materials, including maps, atlases, gazetteers, geographical dictionaries, and other reference works. Among the highlights of the collection are Abraham Ortelius's 1570 "Americae sive novi Orbis, nova Descriptio", an early map of the Americas; Giambattista Nolli's 1798 "Nuova Pianta di Roma", a map of Rome; Giovanni Battista Piranesi's 1746 "Plan of the Course of the Tiber", a plan of the Tiber River commissioned by Pope Benedict XIV; an 1809 pocket globe, and Guillaume Coutans's 1880 "Tableau Topographique des Environs de Paris". The Library is storing and preserving digitized version of their maps in a new digital collection. The collection currently contains over 100 maps. The Clark Library Government Information Collection serves as a center for government documents. The university is a Federal Depository Library for U.S. government documents, and is also the a depository for publications of the State of Michigan, government of Canada, United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and European Union. The University's collection of publications of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Trade Organization (WTO) are also held at the Clark Library. Highlights of the Government Information Collection include a full run of all U.S. congressional publications since 1789, all UN documents since 1946, and all U.S. Census documents since 1790. The library's Spatial and Numeric Data Services (SAND) is housed at the Clark Library and on North Campus at SAND North in the Spatial Analysis Lab (room 2207) of the Art and Architecture Building. SAND assists in research, and "locates, acquires, and converts numeric and spatial data sets, especially social science data sets. SAND also supports the use of geographic information systems (GIS) software. Special Collections Library The Special Collections Library is "home to some of the most historically significant treasures at the University of Michigan." The collection is non-circulating, with many materials stored off-site and retrieved upon request. The Special Collections Library includes around 275,000 published volumes, as well as an estimated 6,500 linear feet of archival material, about 450 incunabula (pre-1501 books), and almost 1,400 early manuscripts on vellum and paper. The Special Collections Library also includes an estimated 20,000 posters and prints and 10,000 photographs. Notable strengths of the Special Collections Library include: Jewish Heritage Collection The Library's special collection on Jewish history and culture, from a gift made jointly to the Frankel Center for Judaic Studies and the University Library. Includes more than 1,500 books, 1,000 works of art (drawings, paintings, engravings, woodcuts, lithographs, and prints); 700 items of ephemera (cards, calendars, clippings, postcards, and mementoes); and some 200 objects, including both (menorahs, groggers, yarmulkes, Challah covers, besamim) and other objects (toys, candles, serving trays). Area Programs Library The Area Programs Libraries consists of four divisions: Near East; Slavic, East European, and Eurasian; South Asia; and Southeast Asia Division. The Hatcher Graduate Library is connected by a skyway to the Shapiro Library Building, which houses three libraries: The University Library contains collections that support the university's museums: One of the largest medical libraries in America with comprehensive collections in all facets of health care and medical research, the Taubman Health Sciences Library also has extensive online collections and is a member of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine, a gateway for access to over a thousand medical libraries nationwide. The Taubman Health Sciences Library has recently introduced the Clinical Librarian Service for the growing information needs of health professionals within the University of Michigan Health System who cannot easily leave their units, clinics or health centers. The Alfred Taubman Health Sciences Library Rare Book Room, in Room 5919, contains rare volumes of significance to the history of medicine. Access is by appointment only. The Rare Book Room contains approximately 6,300 titles dating from 1470 to the early 20th century, consisting primarily of pre-1850 imprints. It includes 82 incunabula, 52 magical medical amulets, as well as medical fugitive sheets, manuscripts, letters, medical cartoons, medical portraits, medical illustrations, and medical artifacts. Particular strengths of the collection are early 19th-century American medical literature; anatomy; surgery; homeopathy; pharmacy and materia medica; obstetrics and gynecology; cardiology; pathology; and hernia treatment. Two University Libraries are located on the UM North Campus: the Music Library and the Art, Architecture & Engineering Library (AAEL). The Music Library is on the third floor of the Earl V. Moore Music Building. The Music Library's collections feature extensive materials in performance, musicology, composition, theory, and dance,including scores, serials, and sound and video recordings in many formats. The Art, Architecture & Engineering Library, in the Duderstadt Center, features more than 600,000 volumes, thousands of periodicals, and over 200 databases in the disciplines of art and design, architecture, engineering, and urban planning. The library has especially strong collections in early twentieth-century art and design, with many materials on the Bauhaus school, Le Corbusier, Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. There are also several collections that are affiliated with the university, but are not part of the University Library system. Two historical libraries are the Bentley Historical Library and the William L. Clements Library. The former is home of the University of Michigan's archives as well as the Michigan Historical Collections, while the latter houses original resources for the study of American history and culture from the 15th to the early 20th century. The Clements Library is believed to be the first stand alone rare books collection at a public university. Other libraries include the Law School Library, the Ronald and Deborah Freedman Library of the Population Studies Center, and the Transportation Research Institute Library. The last library is one of the world's most extensive collections of literature on traffic safety. There is also a large number of independent departmental libraries, as well as small libraries in many student dormitories. The only off-campus library in the University of Michigan system is the Biological Station Library. Its collection consists of over 16,000 cataloged volumes and more than 50 paper journals. It specializes in limnology, ornithology, ecology, systematics, taxonomy, and natural history. Located in Pellston, Michigan, near the northern tip of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, the University of Michigan Biological Station is dedicated to education and research in field biology and environmental science. Not considered an independent library, but nevertheless a key facility for the entire U-M library system, the Buhr Remote Shelving Facility stores in a preservation-sensitive environment over two million items too fragile or rarely used to be kept in the main libraries. Michigan Publishing (formerly "MPublishing") is a library publishing initiative which is "the hub of scholarly publishing at the University of Michigan." Major activities of Michigan Publishing include: "publishing monographs in print and electronic forms; hosting and publishing journals, with an emphasis on online, open-access formats; developing new digital publishing models with the potential to become community portals for wider knowledge sharing; creating permanent, accessible versions of faculty publications and related materials; publishing and copyright consultation and education; rights advocacy for University of Michigan authors; reissuing materials from our collections and our faculty in new forms (reprints, electronic editions)." Michigan Publishing hosts and helps operated 25 University of Michigan-based journals and scholarly conference proceedings in a variety of fields. It also operates Deep Blue, the university's institutional repository. Michigan Publishing operates several print-on-demand programs. The University of Michigan Faculty Reprints (FRS) returns out-of-print books written by university faculty back into circulation on an openly accessible and affordable basis, both online and in print. The library also has an Espresso Book Machine on the first floor of the Shapiro Undergraduate Library. The University of Michigan Press is a component of Michigan Publishing. The Scholarly Publishing Office (SPO) was a unit of the University of Michigan Library devoted to developing innovative and economically sustainable publishing and distribution models for scholarly discourse. Its staff, services, and imprints are now part of Michigan Publishing. Created in 2001, the Scholarly Publishing Office provided a suite of publishing services to scholars at U-M and beyond, in order to provide alternatives to commercial academic publishing. In addition to developing cost-effective methods of publication, SPO also helped scholars increase access to their work by making it openly available online, within a trusted and durable digital library environment. Library-based publishing services such as those offered by the Scholarly Publishing Office contribute to a more robust, efficient, and diverse system of scholarly communication. In 2009 it was absorbed into a new brand name, "MPublishing", was in turn renamed to "Michigan Publishing" in 2013. SPO was unique among publishers because of its affiliation with a major university library. Historically, libraries have defined their mission according to the rubrics of collecting, preserving, cataloging, and distributing the fruits of scholarly inquiry. For many years this broadly conceived mission has sufficed; today, the economics of the publishing world have created a situation in which the status quo is impossible to maintain. Library budgets for public universities like the U-M are either cut or stagnant, while the costs of publishing in print form continue to rise. Publishing conglomerates drive subscription rates up, while libraries struggle—and in many case fail—to keep up. Smaller academic publishing houses do not generate sufficient revenue to support themselves, and their institutional subsidies have been slashed. Many presses have closed, and those that remain have raised prices for their books to a near-prohibitive level, further restricting sales. Harnessing the flexibility and relatively inexpensive resources of electronic publishing, SPO responded to the economic challenges of scholarly publication by providing a cost-effective, sustainable, permanent, and user-friendly publishing option for journals that could not sustain the cost of print publication and distribution. Starting with "Philosopher's Imprint", a peer-reviewed journal produced by the University of Michigan Department of Philosophy, SPO published over a dozen journals and provided for-fee hosting for non-profit academic organizations' subscription products. For example, SPO hosted the American Council of Learned Society's ACLS Humanities Ebook (now hosted by Michigan Publishing) and the Law Library Microfilm Consortium's LLMC-Digital, a database of legal research materials. SPO also offered limited monograph publication and a print on demand service, as well as offering non-traditional publication services, such as online versions of exhibits curated by the University of Michigan's Special Collections Library. SPO began a collaboration with the University of Michigan Press, called the Michigan Digital Publishing Initiative, to explore the possibilities of new publishing partnerships between libraries and traditional, print-based academic presses. The first fruits of this alliance was digitalculturebooks, an imprint that offers books on the role of technology in contemporary society in both print and digital formats. SPO actively pursued new and promising partnerships and publication opportunities. For example, it released the online publication of the "Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists" (BASP), in partnership with the University of Michigan Library's Papyrology Collection. BASP is the only journal in the field of papyrology published in North America and is the official journal of the American Society of Papyrologists. Since the early 1990s, the University of Michigan Library has been a leader among research libraries in efforts to digitize its vast collections. The Digital Library Production Service (DLPS) of the U-M Library oversees the digitization of Library materials, and the development of online access systems for these digitized materials. In furtherance of this goal, DLPS developed its own digital library software, called Digital Library Extension Service (DLXS), that provides a uniform interface for its digitized items. DLPS oversees the scanning and optical character recognition of about 5,000 texts per year, many of them rare, brittle, or delicate. The Digital Library Production Service hosts many searchable digital collections. Among them are: DLPS is also affiliated with the Text Creation Partnership (TCP) to create searchable, full-text versions of works digitized in the Early English Books Online, Evans Early American Imprints, and the Eighteenth Century Collection Online projects. TCP, when its work is concluded, will have produced over 40,000 XML-encoded text files—making it one of the largest collections of its kind. In December 2004 the University Library and Google announced their plans to digitize the over 7 million print volumes held by the Library. Especially old and fragile items, or items in special collections, will not be handled by Google; these the Library will scan itself. It is estimated that it will take approximately six years for Google to complete the scanning process; without Google, the U-M Library was on pace to have their entire collection scanned in about 1000 years. All costs for the project are borne by Google, and the company has developed special scanning technology to ensure that the books are not damaged during the process. All books that are out of copyright will be available for the public to read online; those still in copyright will be searchable, but only brief excerpts will be available to read. Copyright holders, such as publishers and authors, who do not want their books to be scanned can request to have their works excluded from the project, though the Library and Google both maintain that authors and publishers benefit from having their works digitized, since it will make them easier to find and will potentially bring more sales. Though the project has been revolutionary, it is not without controversy. In September 2005 a lawsuit was filed against Google charging copyright infringement. The lawsuit is still pending, but the scanning goes on. On June 6, 2007, twelve universities cooperating as the Committee on Institutional Cooperation (CIC) announced a new partnership with Google whose explicit goal was to offer a public, shared digital repository of all the open access content. That shared repository of library partners became HathiTrust. The University of Michigan, which developed the MBooks platform for its own digitized books, partnered with Indiana University and the CIC libraries and the University of California system to create governance and models for financial support. The partnership has grown to include more than 60 institutions. Using a variety of metrics such as accessibility, materials expenditures, volumes held, and staff size, the Association for Research Libraries (ARL) has consistently ranked the UM library system among the top ten in the nation. Although Michigan ranks 3rd among academic libraries as to total volumes held, it ranks 1st for unique titles held among all institutions reporting that statistic. The ARL data is now behind a paywall, but a university page notes that the current volume count posted to the ARL site is the count contained in the infobox: approaching 13 million volumes as of 2012-2013. Financial support has grown to roughly $58,000,000 per annum. </doc> <doc id="2344037" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344037" title="Greenwich, New York"> Greenwich, New York Greenwich, New York may refer to: </doc> <doc id="2344041" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344041" title="Charles Beauclerk, 11th Duke of St Albans"> Charles Beauclerk, 11th Duke of St Albans Charles Victor Albert Aubrey de Vere Beauclerk, 11th Duke of St Albans (26 March 1870 – 19 September 1934) was a British peer and soldier, known as Earl of Burford before 1898. Beauclerk was the eldest son of the 10th Duke of St Albans and a godchild of Queen Victoria and Albert, Prince of Wales. He was educated at Eton and afterwards joined the 1st Regiment of Life Guards as a Second Lieutenant in 1893, becoming Captain of the South Nottinghamshire Yeomanry in 1898 and later serving with the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Scots Regiment. Beauclerk inherited his father's titles in 1898 and died in 1934, aged 64. He was unmarried and childless and his titles passed to his half-brother, Osborne. Beauclerk suffered from severe depression all his life, according to his half-brother Osborne or "Obby". Trustees looked after his affairs from 1898 until his death in 1934. He was confined under certificates at Ticehurst Asylum from January 1899 till his death. </doc> <doc id="2344047" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344047" title="List of museums and collections at the University of Michigan"> List of museums and collections at the University of Michigan The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor is home to a number of museums. Located on the university's Central Campus are University of Michigan Museum of Natural History; the University of Michigan Museum of Art; the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology; Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry of the School of Dentistry. Adjacent to the Central Campus is the Nichols Arboretum and Matthaei Botanical Gardens. Located on the university's North Campus is the Warren Robbins Gallery and Slusser Gallery of the Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design and the Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments of the School of Music, Theatre & Dance. The University of Michigan Museum of Natural History, formerly known as the Exhibit Museum of Natural History, began in the mid-19th century and expanded greatly with the donation of 60,000 specimens by Joseph Beal Steere, an UM alumnus, in the 1870s. The building also houses three research museums: the Museum of Anthropology, Museum of Paleontology. Today, the collections are primarily housed and displayed in the Ruthven Museums Building which was completed in 1928. The Ruthven Building includes a planetarium and exhibits on geology, paleontology in Michigan, Michigan wildlife, Native American culture and anthropology. The Museum of Anthropology is a research, teaching, and curation unit of the College of Literature, Science and Arts for anthropological and archaeological collections from around the world. The collections support undergraduate and graduate education, and a portion are displayed in the University Exhibit Museum. The Museum of Anthropology formally started in 1922. The Museum of Anthropology is open to researchers, classes and members of the public by appointment. The Museum of Paleontology is a research and teaching museum illuminating the history and meaning of life through geological time. The Museum of Paleontology is located in the University's Ruthven Museum of Natural History. Some Museum of Paleontology collections are housed in the Kipke Building on the University's south or athletic campus. The Museum of Zoology (UMMZ), whose collection includes over 15 million specimens representing all orders of birds, amphibians and reptiles, mites, and insects, and over 80% of orders of fish and mollusks. The Exhibit Museum holds the largest display of dinosaur specimens in Michigan , as well as specimens of the state fossil, the mastodon (the only such display in the world containing adult male and female specimens: the Buesching and Owosso mastodons). Another museum located on Central Campus is the Kelsey Museum of Archeology, which has a collection of Roman, Greek, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern artifacts. Between 1972 and 1974, the museum was involved in the excavation of the archaeological site of Dibsi Faraj in northern Syria. The Kelsey Museum re-opened November 1, 2009 after a renovation and expansion. The University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) is a meeting place for the arts, bridging visual art and contemporary culture, scholarship and accessibility, tradition and innovation. The museum's collections include nearly 19,000 objects that span cultures, eras, and media and include European, American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African art, as well as changing exhibits. The Museum of Art re-opened in 2009 after a three-year renovation and expansion. UMMA presents special exhibitions and diverse educational programs featuring the visual, performing, film and literary arts that contextualize the gallery experience. Also on Central Campus and housed in the School of Dentistry building is the Sindecuse Museum of Dentistry. The collection contains over 15,000 objects pertaining to the history of the dental profession. Nichols Arboretum is a 123-acre site adjacent to Central Campus. The entrance from campus is on Washington Heights near the University Hospital complex. The ceremonial entrance is on Geddes Road. The Detroit Observatory is adjacent to the University Hospital complex.

The game was developed by Konami and was first unveiled at the Japan Amusement Machinery Manufacturers Association in September 2001. The game had been released in Japan by November 2001, and was later released in the United States in March 2002. The game uses the same cabinet and motion sensor technology as "Police 911", requiring players to dodge the oncoming dinosaur attacks. Alternatively, the standard cabinet provides a left and right button to perform evasive maneuvers. It was preceded by "" in 1997, also a light gun game, but from Sega. In the game, the player must kill dinosaurs by aiming and shooting at them with the light gun. The player is given 8 bullets to shoot and must reload by shooting outside of the screen every time all 8 bullets are used. A health bar is shown, which gets smaller each time the player receives damage. If the bar is gone, the game is over unless the player puts in more coins and hits the "start" or "continue" button. After a boss is killed, the player is sometimes given more health if he or she did well killing the boss. There are also two left and right arrow buttons on the dash of the console, which allows the player(s) to "Run away" from the dinosaur(s) to avoid taking damage during boss battles. Two mercenary soldiers employed by InGen land on Isla Sorna by parachute, with orders by Alan Grant to rescue survivors that crashed on the island earlier on in the story (not shown). The Rangers soon see a pack of "Compsognathus" attacking one survivor. The player(s) now has to fight "Compsognathus", "Dilophosaurus", and "Velociraptor" until the survivor is found. Then a cinematic cuts to a nearby pond, revealing a sleeping "Spinosaurus" underwater, which suddenly opens its eye. It then bursts from the pond and charges at the player(s) who must repeatedly escape it while fighting more "Compsognathus", "Dilophosaurus", and "Velociraptor". This is the first boss. Weak points on boss enemies are indicated by red crosshairs on certain body parts. After several attacks on the dinosaur, the player(s) reaches the landing area where the game started. However, the "Spinosaurus" follows them into the clearing, resulting in the second boss battle. The player(s) must repeatedly dodge it by hiding behind crates and shooting. Eventually the "Spinosaurus" gives up then the player and their teammates escape in an armored jeep. Another cinematic shows the "Spinosaurus" fighting a "Tyrannosaurus", but the player(s) drive(s) away before a winner is revealed. The next level begins when the rangers find that there are more survivors in the hatchery. The player(s) stay(s) in the car at this time, fighting an "Ankylosaurus", but the dinosaur quickly topples and destroys the car. This is the third boss. After it is killed, the player(s) reaches the hatchery, where several more survivors are rescued from a pack of raptors. The player(s) then exit(s) the building, only to find one last survivor being menaced by a "Tyrannosaurus". The player(s) must fight it while avoiding to be eaten. This is the fourth boss. Once the "Tyrannosaurus" is killed, the player(s) begins heading for the coast. On the way to the coast, the player(s) must pass through the "Pteranodon" aviary. After defeating a group of the flying creatures, as well as some more raptors, the player(s) must fight the fifth boss, a giant (alpha) mutant "Pteranodon". After defeating it, the group heads to a boat, fighting more "Velociraptor" along the way. As the group moves across the river, they are assaulted by more "Velociraptor", "Compsognathus", "Dilophosaurus", and "Pteranodon". After surviving these attacks, the player(s) faces off against the "Spinosaurus" which attacks while taking cover underwater. This is the sixth boss. When the group reaches shore, they make their way through a wooded forest and fight off another pack of "Velociraptors", until night falls in and they reach their goal, the Marina. There, the "Spinosaurus" appears and attacks the group in a flaming background. This is the seventh and final boss. After defeating and killing the "Spinosaurus", the group gets on the boat and they leave the island. Jon Thompson of AllGame rated "Jurassic Park III" three half and a half stars and wrote that the game's most disappointing aspect was its graphics: "it still appears to be stuck in a time warp from several years ago. Even as the dinosaurs in the films have become more sophisticated, the visual treat that could have been offered to players isn't present here. It looks as if the game was built on the same engine as The Lost World. While the look is certainly servicable, it just isn't compelling. Characters, dinosaurs, and environments are blocky and unrefined [...]. Jurassic Park III was obviously not developed with the idea it would be a classic." Thompson wrote that the game's Escape button "doesn't play enough into the game to be considered a major or revolutionary feature," and that the feature "becomes less and less useful" as the game progresses. Thompson praised the game's music and sound effects, but concluded, "What players are left with is a thrillless, blocky, predictable experience, and will fail to impress fans of the previous Jurassic Park shooting games. Like the movie on which it is based, this title feels like an also-ran." </doc> <doc id="2344050" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344050" title="Tuukka Rask"> Tuukka Rask Tuukka Mikael Rask (born 10 March 1987) is a Finnish professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). Rask was drafted 21st overall in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft by the Toronto Maple Leafs. On 24 June 2006, his rights were traded to the Bruins in exchange for goaltender Andrew Raycroft. He is the older brother of Joonas Rask, who plays professionally as a forward with HIFK in the Finnish Liiga. Rask started his career in the youth teams of his hometown club SaPKo in Savonlinna, Finland. He then played in 28 games for the Tampere-based Ilves Jr. in the Finnish Junior League. His goals against average (GAA) was 1.86 with two shutouts and a .935 save percentage. He was the top ranked European goaltender in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. Rask played his last European ice hockey season as the number one goaltender for the Ilves senior team in the Finnish top-flight SM-liiga. The Toronto Maple Leafs drafted Rask in the first round, 21st overall, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. However, before playing a regular season game for Toronto, he was traded to the Boston Bruins in exchange for former Calder Memorial Trophy-winning goaltender Andrew Raycroft. Toronto management had deemed Justin Pogge their potential goaltender of the future, rendering Rask expendable. It was later revealed the Bruins intended to release Raycroft, which would have made him available to Toronto without having to give up Rask. The trade has since been examined as one of the worst trades in Maple Leafs franchise history; Rask would experience many seasons of success with the Bruins, eventually winning the Stanley Cup and Vezina Trophy, while Raycroft would only play two seasons for Toronto, recording disappointing statistics in the process. On 5 May 2007, Rask signed a three-year contract with the Boston Bruins and was in attendance to observe the Providence Bruins' 2006–07 playoff run for the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Calder Cup championship. The Providence team did not make it past the second round of the Calder Cup against the Manchester Monarchs, but nonetheless Rask practiced with the Providence team. On 5 November 2007, Rask was called-up to the Boston Bruins for the first time. Just two weeks later, on 20 November, he recorded his first NHL win, a 4–2 victory on the road against his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. On 3 October 2008, the Bruins reassigned Rask to Providence. Rask had the best save percentage (.952) among the goalies in pre-season play, followed by teammates Manny Fernandez (.875), Tim Thomas (.869) and Kevin Regan (.857). Despite this, the team opted to go with the two veteran goaltenders, Thomas and Fernandez, for the 2008–09 season. With nagging back spasms keeping Fernandez from play shortly after the All-Star Game break, Rask was once again called-up to serve as a second goaltender, and on 31 January 2009, he played his first (and only) game with the Bruins in the 2008–09 season, and earned his first ever NHL shutout, a 1–0 home effort against the New York Rangers, with Marc Savard scoring the only Bruins goal. Not long after the beginning of the 2009–10 season, Rask, who had been named the backup goaltender to Thomas, signed a two-year extension to his contract with the Bruins on 5 November that kept him under contract through to the 2011–12 season. In the 2009–10 regular season, Rask was the only goaltender in the NHL with a GAA of less than 2.00 and the only goaltender with a save percentage over .930. Despite having been the only qualifying rookie in NHL history to lead the league with a sub-2.00 GAA, as well as lead the league in save percentage, and having supplanted the Vezina Trophy winner Tim Thomas as the starter, Rask was not named as a finalist for the rookie of the year award. In the 2010–11 season, Thomas returned to form, effectively relegating Rask once again to the backup role. With the Bruins winning the Stanley Cup in 2011, Rask became only the second Finnish goaltender to do so, after Antti Niemi of the Chicago Blackhawks accomplished the feat the previous year. On 28 June 2012, Rask re-signed with the Bruins to a one-year, $3.5 million contract. Prior to the declaration of the 2012–13 lockout, Rask was named as the starting goaltender for the Bruins, replacing Tim Thomas, who would eventually be traded to the New York Islanders on 7 February 2013. During the lockout, which ended on 6 January 2013, Rask played for HC Plzeň, which won the Czech Extraliga that year. After the NHL resumed play, Rask led the Bruins to their second Stanley Cup finals in three years in the 2013 playoffs. In the third round against the Pittsburgh Penguins, Rask faced 136 shots in four games played, allowing two goals while making 134 saves for a 0.50 GAA and a .985 save percentage. In the Stanley Cup finals, the Bruins were defeated in six games by the Chicago Blackhawks, as Rask registered a .932 save percentage. On 10 July 2013, the Bruins re-signed Rask to an eight-year, $56 million contract. Following the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, Rask was awarded the NHL's Vezina Trophy, awarded to the "goalkeeper adjudged to be the best at his position". He posted a 36–15–6 record, highlighted by a career-best ten-game points-won streak from 20 to 30 March, going 9–0–1, as the Bruins captured their first Presidents' Trophy since 1990 and led the Eastern Conference in team defence (2.08 goals allowed per game). Early in the 2016–17 regular season, Rask sustained a groin injury that somewhat hampered his abilities much of the season following a successful October campaign, starting the 2016–17 season with 12 wins and a .938 save percentage in 17 games. He was likely used more often than usual, with the Bruins suffering from "backup goaltender" challenges early in the season, but not enough of a hindrance to help lead the Bruins to the 2017 playoffs, the Bruins' first in three seasons. Following a six-game quarterfinal series with the Bruins losing to the Ottawa Senators four games to two, Rask successfully underwent groin surgery on 9 May 2017. In mid-August, Rask said he expected to be ready for the Bruins' training camp for the 2017–18 season. In the 2017–18 season, from 26 November 2017 to 10 February 2018, Rask had a career-high 21-game point streak. Rask and the Bruins ended up finishing the season with 50 wins and 112 points, their best season since their 2013–14 Presidents' Trophy-winning season. He played only 54 games, his lowest since that same 2013–14 season, posting a 34–14–5 record with a 2.36 GAA and a .917 save percentage. In the 2018 playoffs, the Bruins were defeated in the second round in five games by the Tampa Bay Lightning, with Rask playing 12 games total in the playoffs and posting a 2.88 GAA and .903 save percentage, his worst since the 2010 playoff campaign, the first of his career. Rask played in four of Finland's six games en route to the Bronze medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics, including a 3–1 defeat of host nation Russia in the quarter-finals, and a shut-out of the United States in the Bronze medal game. He was unable to play in the semifinal against Sweden due to flu, which cost Finland a spot in the final. On 2 March 2016, it was revealed Rask was to be starting goaltender for Finland In the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, ahead of Pekka Rinne. Rask played in two out of three tournament games and in one out of three pre-tournament games. In 2015, a recently discovered species of wasp in Kenya was named "Thaumatodryinus tuukkaraski" as a direct reference to Rask. The reasoning given by the authors was, "This species is named after the acrobatic goaltender for the Finnish National ice hockey team and the Boston Bruins, whose glove hand is as tenacious as the raptorial fore tarsus of this dryinid species." </doc> <doc id="2344060" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344060" title="Kimberly Elise"> Kimberly Elise Kimberly Elise Trammel (born April 17, 1967), professionally known as Kimberly Elise, is an American film and television actress.

Co-produced by Mike Hedges and the Cure's Robert Smith, it was released as a single from the band's second album "Seventeen Seconds" on 8 April 1980. It was their debut entry on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 31. The accompanying music video was first shown on BBC's "Top of the Pops" programme on 24 April 1980. Recorded and mixed over seven days, along with the rest of the songs from the album, "A Forest" is representative of the Cure's early-1980s gothic rock phase. The song has featured on the band's setlists for many years. Several versions have appeared on concert albums, and it was remixed and released as a single from "Mixed Up" in 1990. Mike Hedges co-produced the album "Seventeen Seconds" as well as "A Forest" with the Cure's Robert Smith. Hedges had first worked with the band on the track "Killing an Arab". Interviewed in 2004, he did not recall any demos existing for "Seventeen Seconds"; the band generally played the track in the studio before laying down a backing track to which overdubs were added. At the time of the recording of the album, bass guitarist Simon Gallup and keyboardist Matthieu Hartley had been added to the band's lineup. Gallup had replaced Michael Dempsey, who had departed to join The Associates. Gallup and Hartley joined remaining Cure members Smith (vocals) and Lol Tolhurst (drums) in late 1979 during the group's Future Pastimes tour, on which "A Forest" was one of the new songs added to their setlist. Due to budgetary restraints, "Seventeen Seconds" was recorded and mixed in seven days on a budget of between £2000 and £3000, which resulted in the band working 16 or 17 hours a day to complete the album. Hedges and Robert Smith knew "A Forest" would take more work to complete than other songs on the album, and would require more overdubs. "A Forest" was one of the last tracks recorded; the backing tracks were recorded first, followed by touch-ups to the individual parts, then Smith's vocals. Fiction Records owner Chris Parry told Smith that the song had the potential to be a hit if they made it sound "radio friendly", but Smith refused, stating that the way the track sounded was the sound he envisioned in his head, dismissing concerns about radio friendliness. Work on mixing "A Forest" took up much of the final day of sessions for the album. "A Forest" and its parent album "Seventeen Seconds" are representative of the Cure's gothic rock phase in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Cure biographer Jeff Apter refers to "A Forest" as "the definitive early Cure mood piece" and he argued the song is the centrepiece of the album. Smith's intention with "A Forest" was to make a song that was "really atmospheric". He has stated that it was a pivotal recording for the group, and represented "the archetypal Cure sound". "A Forest" is performed in the key of A minor. Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed by the introduction of the bass guitar and a second guitar part. The song initially follows an Am–C–F–Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains a B–C–F#m–C–B–C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word "again", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a pentatonic manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at 4.46". The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s. Mike Hedges favored the use of flanging at the time, and he estimated that there were seven flanger devices used on "A Forest". Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in "A Forest" "almost became a Smith trademark for a while". Simon Gallup said that his playing on the track was intended to be reminiscent of the bass work in the music of The Stranglers, whose bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel was a major influence on him. Smith has given varying explanations behind his lyrics for "A Forest". He has said that the lyrics were based upon a dream he had as a child where he was lost in the woods unable to escape but later denied it and stated, "It's just about a forest". "A Forest" was released as a single on 5 April 1980. Its B-side was "Another Journey by Train", an instrumental remake of the Cure's "Jumping Someone Else's Train". The single received a mixed critical reception, though commercially its sales were an improvement for the band. In early 1980, it spent eight weeks in the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 31 on 12 April of that year. It was the highest they had placed on the chart by that point in their career. In the United States, the song reached number 47 on the "Billboard" Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart. The version included on 1986 compilation "Standing on a Beach" ("") is neither the album version (which was also on the 12" single), nor is it the 7" single edit (which removes a few bars between verses and fades out part way through the guitar solo ending). Andy Anderson, who later became the Cure's drummer, said "A Forest" was the first song he heard by the band. He was taken by both the music and vocals, and was especially drawn to Smith's guitar work and the keyboard melody, which he described as "haunting". He described the spare and simple 4/4 drum pattern as straightforward; "all that is needed." Since its release, "A Forest" has become the most played Cure song, with over 1,000 live appearances. A live version of "A Forest" appeared on a four-song edition of "The Hanging Garden" released in July 1982. It was performed with what has been described as a "rough, punk-edged" sound on the 1984 live album "". A performance appears on the live video "The Cure in Orange", highly regarded by Allmusic reviewer Ned Raggett., while other live versions of the song include the concert film "Show", and on disc one of the live album "Bestival Live 2011". In 1990, the track was re-recorded and remixed by Mark Saunders for the Cure's "Mixed Up" album. The "Tree mix" version of "A Forest" was released as a single on 6 December 1990, while the album had been released a few weeks before on 20 November. The song was redone for the second time on the "" box set, this time remixed by Mark Plati and featuring Earl Slick on guitar. This version was described as "awful" and "instantly dated" by reviewer Chris Ott. An acoustic version was recorded and released on the bonus disc that came with some copies of the 2001 "Greatest Hits" CD. Robert Smith supplied vocals for a Blank & Jones cover version of the song, which appeared on their 2004 album "Monument". The promotional video for "A Forest" was the band's first. It was created by David Hiller, who mixed footage from the band's 24 April 1980 debut appearance on BBC's "Top of the Pops" programme with a forest montage. Smith said that the group "came across looking very morose and disinterested" in the video because that is how they felt at the time; he "hated" Top of the Pops as he was "really anti-pop" during this period. He recalled that he had been in pain at the time of the shoot as he had broken his thumb trying to change a tyre a few days previously. 7" – Fiction/Polydor (UK) (1980) 12" – Fiction/Polydor (UK) (1980) CD/12" – Fiction (UK) (1990) </doc> <doc id="2344072" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344072" title="Fabian Bruskewitz"> Fabian Bruskewitz Fabian Wendelin Bruskewitz (born September 6, 1935) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the eighth Bishop of Lincoln, Nebraska, and retired in 2012. He is known for often taking conservative stands on social issues. Fabian Bruskewitz was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on September 6, 1935. He attended a local parochial school before studying at St. Lawrence Seminary High School in Mount Calvary, Wisconsin and at St. Francis Seminary in Milwaukee. He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical North American College and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he was ordained to the priesthood by Luigi Cardinal Traglia on July 17, 1960, at the Basilica dei Santi Apostoli. Upon his return to the United States, Bruskewitz served as an assistant pastor in parishes near Milwaukee. He later returned to the Gregorian for graduate study, earning a doctorate in dogmatic theology in 1969. He briefly taught at St. Francis Seminary before being assigned to the Congregation for Catholic Education in the Roman Curia, where he worked for eleven years. He was raised to the rank of Monsignor in 1976, becoming an Honorary Prelate of His Holiness in 1980. That same year, he became pastor of St. Bernard Parish in Wauwatosa. On March 24, 1992, Bruskewitz was appointed the eighth Bishop of Lincoln, Nebraska. He received his episcopal consecration on May 13, 1992, from Archbishop Daniel E. Sheehan, with Bishops Glennon Flavin and Leo Brust serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Risen Christ. The diocese has the highest priest-to-Catholic ratio in the United States. It has been suggested that this is due to Bruskewitz' emphasis on orthodoxy, though it has also been ascribed, at least in part, to the presence of a seminary within the diocese; it has also been noted that the adjacent diocese of Omaha has the second-highest ratio. With regard to Lincoln and other dioceses with many priests, it has been noted: "Fidelity to the magisterium and traditional spirituality are strikingly manifest." Bruskewitz himself notes that "the orthodoxy, conservatism, and enthusiasm of the clergy, both young and old, bear witness to the splendor of the Catholic priesthood in southern Nebraska." Bruskewitz was considered one of the most conservative bishops in the Church. Under Bruskewitz, the Lincoln diocese was the only one in the United States where female altar servers were not allowed diocese-wide. Bruskewitz published a book entitled "Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz: A Shepherd Speaks". On September 6, 2010, Bruskewitz formally submitted his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75 for bishops. Pope Benedict accepted his resignation on September 14, 2012, and appointed Bishop James D. Conley, auxiliary of the Archdiocese of Denver, as his successor. In 1997 Bruskewitz publicly attacked an attempt by the US Bishops Conference to reach out to parents trying to cope with the discovery of homosexuality in their adolescent or adult child through the pastoral document, "All our children". He called the document “Calamity and frightening disaster” and advised other Catholics to ignore or oppose it. He has suggested that the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic church is linked to clerical dissent from Catholic sexual ethics more broadly dating to dissent from the Papal Encyclical, "Humanae Vitae", which reaffirmed Catholic teaching on artificial birth control. He unsuccessfully attempted to get the US Bishops Conference to commission a study to examine potential links between sexual abuse by priests and allowing homosexual men into Catholic seminaries. This is because he believes that most sexual abuse by priests is against adolescent boys and rooted in "society's acceptance of homosexuality". He has emphasised therefore that gay men should never be permitted into the priesthood because this encouraged temptation "since priests are regularly in clos proximity with children and young men". In 2016, Bruskewitz stated that efforts to legalize same-sex unions or marriage and to secure other equal rights for LGBT people would lead to persecution of Christians who oppose such measures. Alongside this he described gay relationships as a "degeneration" and "a perversion" that is "repulsive to normal human beings". Bruskewitz has been occasionally at odds with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. For example, he rejected an audit by the Conference's National Review Board of his plans to implement national guidelines on sex-abuse programs, making reference to both the Review Board and the former president of Pace University: Some woman named Patricia O'Donnell Ewers, who is the chair of something called 'A National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People,' has said that her board 'calls for strong fraternal correction of the Diocese of Lincoln.' The Diocese of Lincoln has nothing to be corrected for, since the Diocese of Lincoln is and has always been in full compliance with all laws of the Catholic Church and with all civil laws...The Diocese of Lincoln does not see any reason for the existence of Ewers and her organization. The issue brought his diocese to national attention. Bruskewitz was the only one of 195 bishops attending a June 2002 meeting of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops who refused to sign the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People. Bruskewitz gained national attention in 1996 for decreeing automatic excommunication on Catholics in his diocese for membership in the following groups. In his statement, he asserted "Membership in these organizations or groups is always perilous to the Catholic Faith and most often is totally incompatible with the Catholic Faith." Call to Action appealed to Rome against his decree, but in 2006 the Congregation for Bishops upheld his action. Regis Scanlon considered that the controversy created by Bruskewitz's decree may have been one of the factors that led Cardinal Joseph Bernardin to initiate without success his "Catholic Common Ground Project" to bring American Catholic factions together, based on the belief, which Scanlon decried, that "limited and occasional dissent" from the Magisterium of the Church was "legitimate". In 2004, Bruskewitz stated that he would deny the Eucharist to Catholic politicians who support legislation that permits women the right to conduct an abortion, including 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry. Bruskewitz was one of the earliest proponents of the Tridentine Mass. Before Summorum Pontificum, Bruskewitz was identified in "The Wanderer" as one of the few U.S. bishops "...who have been generous in the Ecclesia Dei indult application, as requested and emphasized repeatedly by the late Pope John Paul II." The others were Archbishop Raymond Burke of St. Louis, Bishop Álvaro Corrada del Rio of Tyler, Texas; and Bishop Thomas Doran of Rockford, Illinois. In 2015 he issued a public letter urging women not to engage in yoga. He argued that yoga has its root in Hinduism, and thus “incompatible to Christianity.” </doc> <doc id="2344076" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344076" title="Marion Bromley"> Marion Bromley Marion Bromley "nee" Coddington (October 10, 1912 – January 21, 1996) was a pioneer of the modern American tax resistance movement and a civil rights activist. She married Ernest Bromley in 1948. In 1948 Bromley left the staff of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (where she had been A.J. Muste's secretary) to avoid the withholding of taxes on her paycheck. Bromley helped found the group Peacemakers later that year, and concentrated her focus on the organization of war tax resistance by that group. She participated in the campaign to desegregate the Coney Island amusement park in 1952. She was with a black couple in a car that attempted to gain access to the park but was attacked by an anti-desegregationist mob (the occupants of the car were charged with disorderly conduct). The first war tax resistance "how to" guide, "Handbook on Nonpayment of War Taxes", was published by Marion and Ernest Bromley in 1963. Bromley participated in the first meeting of the National War Tax Resistance Coordinating Committee in 1982. In the 1970s the Internal Revenue Service tried and failed to seize their home for non-payment of taxes. In 1977 the War Resisters League gave the Bromleys its annual Peace Award. </doc> <doc id="2344077" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344077" title="Heidi Sørensen"> Heidi Sørensen Heidi Sørensen (born 14 February 1970) is a Norwegian politician for the Socialist Left Party.

Originally recognised only in his native Czechoslovakia, Burian's fame later spread to an international audience during a remarkable career spanning six decades (1930s to 1980s). He is regarded by many as one of the most influential palaeoartists of the modern era, and a number of subsequent artists have attempted to emulate his style. Burian was an extremely prolific artist whose works are estimated to number fifteen thousand paintings and drawings (ink pen and pencil). He illustrated many books (including natural history subjects and numerous classic novels such as "Robinson Crusoe", "Tarzan of the Apes", "Plutonia") and book covers, but it is within the fields of palaeontology and palaeoanthropology that Burian's influence has been most notable. Since the late 1950s and early 1960s when Burian's work became known in the west through a series of large-format books released by the Artia publishing house, numerous scholarly and popular books on prehistoric life have featured his work, either as originals or as art based closely on them. Burian's first experience with prehistoric illustration was in the early 1930s, working on the fictional books set in various prehistoric times written by Eduard Štorch, an amateur archaeologist. These illustrations brought him to university palaeontologist Josef Augusta's attention. Burian worked in cooperation with Augusta from 1935 until Augusta's death in 1968. Subsequently, he worked with Zdeněk Špinar. He painted accurate and magnificent reconstructions representing all forms of prehistoric life from many parts of the globe, from the earliest invertebrates to a vast array of fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds, as well as panoramic vistas of the landscapes in which they lived. Close to 500 prehistoric images were painted by him between the early 1930s and 1981. Whilst some of Burian's earliest palaeo works depicting North American species were inspired by the pioneering American palaeo-artist Charles R. Knight (see for example, his first renditions of "Stegosaurus" and "Brontotherium"), partly because Burian lacked access to skeletal material for such reconstructions, Burian's work was less stylised and more convincing with respect to both the subjects and their landscapes, and soon became highly regarded amongst palaeontologists, especially in Europe. Previous palaeo-artists had often produced speculative works reflecting 19th-century views of large dinosaurs as lethargic reptiles akin to giant lizards with sprawling limbs, but Burian convincingly painted them as active animals with parasagittal (mammal or bird-like) limb-movement and musculature. Burian depicted the American sauropods "Brontosaurus" (1940), "Diplodocus" (1952 & 1965?), and "Barosaurus" walking on land in elephantine fashion, and his 1941 reconstruction of the East African sauropod "Brachiosaurus" (the only image showing the main subject in water) became one of the most reproduced dinosaur images in history. Although it is now considered unlikely that "Brachiosaurus" could have inhaled in deep water (unless it had a strengthened pleural cavity as do some whales), the reconstruction is remarkably realistic and was still being reproduced 60 years after it was painted. As with many of his works, Burian's sauropod reconstructions reached iconic status, with the celebrated palaeontologist William Elgin Swinton (1900–1994) noting: "The ideas as well as the pictorially beautiful restorations of Zdenek Burian, done under the direction of the late Joseph Augusta (1962), create a lasting impression that appears to be decisive. The Czechoslovakian experts have placed us all in their debt and the life-restorations of "Brontosaurus, Diplodocus" and "Brachiosaurus" provide debating points as well as aesthetic satisfaction" ("The Dinosaurs", 1970: 189). Another famous Burian painting (dated 1938) shows the dynamism of his work with a "Tyrannosaurus rex" rushing to attack one of a pair of startled duck-billed "Trachodon" as fleet-footed ornithomimids bound off in the distance. Following subsequent palaeontological evidence, the predator was later modified by adding skull protuberances and a stiffer tail. This painting is one of his few works that show dinosaurs in direct conflict. Many of Burian's early paintings appeared in a series of large format books with text by Augusta, the first of which, "Prehistoric Animals", was originally published in Czechoslovakia by Artia (1956) and later in many other countries including Italy, France, Germany, England and Japan. The late S.J. Gould, who was an enthusiast of the work of Charles R. Knight, described it as one of the 20th Century's three most influential visual books on prehistory (many would argue that it was the most influential), and it was followed by a series of other landmark titles: "Prehistoric Birds & Reptiles, Prehistoric Sea Monsters, The Book of Mammoths", and "Prehistoric Man", all of which became famous and collectable in their own right. The influence of Burian's work is clearly discernible in many later films depicting dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals, right up to the Jurassic Park series. Although Burian's reconstructions of extinct life are very convincing, his often-reproduced dinosaur reconstructions were all the more remarkable in that he did not have access to skeletal material, but rather depended largely on drawings and photographs provided by his collaborators Augusta and Špinar (although Czechoslovakia had a notable history of palaeontological research, it lacked dinosaur fossils). In many cases, he undertook anatomical reconstructions of his subjects before depicting life restorations, and sometimes painted more than one version of an animal (particularly if the first version had been painted in black and white), examples being "Dimetrodon", "Tylosaurus", "Brachiosaurus", "Diplodocus", "Stegosaurus", "Brontotherium", "Arsinoitherium", "Phororhacos", "Archaeopteryx" amongst others. Many of Burian's early works were accompanied by text from Augusta (often in an almost story-book fashion) and it is within this context and time frame (1940s to 1968) that Burian produced his most memorable and famous works which were used as educational aids in schools across Czechoslovakia to show the succession of life on Earth. His style reflected a classic, almost romantic imagery that rarely showed animals fighting or preying on each other (although some paintings did show carnivores with their prey, they were generally depicted either before the confrontation or after the prey had been dispatched). Two years after Augusta's death, Burian painted what is regarded as his last classic image, the famous 'heroic' "Tarbosaurus bataar" of Mongolia (an image that was also widely reproduced and copied). Following Augusta's death, conditions were increasingly placed on Burian's artistic licence and the scientific detail of what he painted, whilst he was also being asked to depict different species within the same scenes but as individual, non-interacting animals as in a montage. Given his background as a novel/action-scene illustrator, and the close collaboration with Augusta the 'story-teller', Burian viewed the subjects of his paintings as very real animals (as would a natural history artist), and the new restrictions did not sit well with him. An example of how his work was compromised is evident in another version of "Brachiosaurus" that he painted in his later years under the direction of Vratislav Mazak; the animal, now shown on dry land, appears oddly out of proportion and fails to compare to the celebrated 1941 version. In his later years, Burian was in demand by publishers requesting bland, catalogue-like stand-alone prehistoric animal images as illustrations for reference books, a style that Burian neither favoured nor excelled at. Burian's works, which vary in size from A4 to several square metres, were mostly executed in oils, both in colour and black and white, and exhibit keen attention to detail and unmistakable realism whilst maintaining a strong sense of atmosphere. Whilst his style was very traditional, it was combined with a dynamism that represented a break with the often staid palaeo-reconstructions of previous artists. A feature of many of the paintings, and one that is missing from the work of other palaeo artists, is the realistic effect of movement and action which was achieved not only by the dynamic positions of the subjects, but by a clever blurring of the edges of moving objects (such as the tips of waves or palm fronds in the wind) to produce a clever effect of photo-realism. It has often been noted that Burian's renditions appear to have been painted from life, so close is the perceived association between the subject and its environment. This is perhaps not surprising given that Burian was already well accomplished at painting natural history subjects before he began painting prehistoric scenes. Many Burian paintings have become celebrated images of palaeontology and palaeoanthropology, especially the frequently reproduced images of Mesozoic reptiles (pterosaurs, dinosaurs, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs) whilst his evocative depictions of proboscideans, Ice Age mammals, and a remarkable series of paintings of early hominids through to modern man are without equal. He also painted extant native peoples of the world, including those of Africa, South America and the South Pacific. Original Burian paintings are on exhibit at Dvůr Králové Zoo (especially his large oil canvas), at the National Museum (Prague) and at the Anthropos Museum in Brno (particularly his anthropological reconstructions). Initially released by Czech publishers followed by western publishers Paul Hamlyn and Thames & Hudson with translated texts, Burian's work was later widely reproduced (often as teaching material) by European and American authors (including Edwin Colbert). Images based on his paintings have featured on postage stamps issued by many countries, and the pioneering director/animator Karel Zeman used Burian paintings as guides to produce 2-D and 3-D animated models for his 1955 landmark feature film "Cesta do pravěku" (released in altered format in the US as "Journey to the Beginning of Time"). The 1985 Soviet mini-series "Guest from the Future" employed Burian's artwork in a scene where robot Werther compares young boy Kolya to various life forms in order to ascertain his identity. Burian's work has probably inspired more imitators in the field of palaeo-reconstruction than any other artist, and his prehistoric paintings have frequently been copied, and not always with acknowledgement. A notable case is "A New Look at the Dinosaurs", by Alan J. Charig (1979), British Museum Natural History, which featured thinly-disguised ink copies of Burian paintings inversed as mirror images. Numerous other examples include many Adèle Blanc-sec comic strips which depict dinosaurs closely resembling Burian's work (e.g. the "Tarbosaurus" [tome 2] and the pterodactyl of 'Adèle and the Beast'), the 1992 video game "Ecco the Dolphin" which features in-game artwork inspired by Burian and recreated in pixels by Zsolt Balogh, and the hunting game series "Carnivores" containing creatures influenced by Burian's art. In 2015, Google Doodle commemorated his 110th birthday. In 2017, the first valid Czech dinosaur was named "Burianosaurus augustai", honouring both Burian and Josef Augusta. </doc> <doc id="2344096" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2344096" title="Marty Markowitz"> Marty Markowitz Martin "Marty" Markowitz (born February 14, 1945) is a former Borough President of Brooklyn, New York City. He was first elected in 2001 after serving 23 years as a New York State Senator. His third and final term ended in December 2013. He was born and raised in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in a Jewish family. His father, Robert, was a waiter at Sid's, a kosher delicatessen but died when Marty was nine years old; his mother, Dorothy, moved the family to public housing in Sheepshead Bay. Markowitz graduated from Wingate High School in Brooklyn's Prospect Lefferts Gardens section in 1962. He took night classes at Brooklyn College for nine years, and received his bachelor's degree in Political Science in 1970. Markowitz began his public service career in 1971, at the age of 26, by forming the Flatbush Tenants Council in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Flatbush. The organization grew into Brooklyn Housing & Family Services, which is the largest tenants advocacy organization operating in New York State today. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1979 to 2001, sitting in the 183rd, 184th, 185th, 186th, 187th, 188th, 189th, 190th, 191st, 192nd, 193rd and 194th New York State Legislatures. He was known for creating a series of oceanfront concerts and other festivals rather than drafting legislation. Markowitz first ran for Borough President in 1985, but failed to unseat the incumbent Howard Golden. Markowitz subsequently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for failing to disclose a campaign contribution; he was fined and performed community service. He was elected to the borough presidency in 2001, as the Democratic candidate and was re-elected on November 8, 2005, with 79% of the vote, compared to 13% for Republican challenger Theodore Alatsas, and 7% for Gloria Mattera, the Green Party candidate. As borough presidents have little real power within city government, Markowitz used the office to be an aggressive advocate for Brooklyn, promoting mainstream tourism and events. In the 2005 New York City mayoral election, he also endorsed Republican incumbent Michael Bloomberg, as did many other Democrats including Ed Koch. During the Blackout of 2003, he stood on the Brooklyn Bridge as throngs of fellow Brooklynites trudged home from work in Manhattan, holding a megaphone and cheering "Welcome home to Brooklyn!" to thunderous applause. He repeated this during the 2005 New York City transit strike, inviting Brooklynites into Borough Hall for warm drinks and a chance to call loved ones. He frequently spoke at public schools in Brooklyn on occasions such as performances and graduations. Markowitz called for demolition of the residences at Admiral's Row, saying they are damaged beyond repair. However, the Beardsley / Crawford & Stearns report commissioned by the National Guard as part of the Section 106 review of the property disputes this claim. In 2006, Markowitz stated that "a crucial community resource must take priority over preservation at Admirals Row", presumably
